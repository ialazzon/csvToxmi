Imagine the magic of walking onto a public school campus and hearing young voices raised in song coming from one room and the sound of enthusiastic drumming and percussion coming from another. Imagine a group of pre-teen girls sitting outside together strumming guitars and ukuleles, while another group of middle school students work on the lyrics and music for an original song. These images are a wonderful reality on our campus and we are working hard to keep it that way, despite the funding cuts. \n\nOur school has a clear commitment to arts education and research shows that students who have quality experiences with the arts develop self confidence, and learn skills that assist them in becoming stronger students in their other studies.\n\nAs well stated by one of our students, ""I'm surprised by the different instruments that have learned to play and I LOVE to rock out!""\n "

So, it is very difficult for parents to send money in for such things as materials to do a special project, a field trip, or everyday supplies for a normal school day to help enhance their child education.\n\nThis is why the Kindergarten grade level believes that if we can introduce some of the SOL at an early part of a child's educational career by doing a special project connection piece this will assist in laying a firm foundation for them. Such as, exploring the different types of animal life cycles this is a great way to introduce the Science SOL and give the students several different hands-on projects that will close the gap of understanding the life cycle.

Finally, this project will help them become experts on conducting a successful interview, a skill that will serve them immeasurably as they head off to college.  \n\nYou will empower my students to become active learners and participants in understanding and connecting to the real-world historical sources that surround them.  Stories that might go untold will be captured and shared with an appropriate historical contextual understanding to be shared across our school and city.  This is history in action and you can make it possible."

We are a K-6 school and our students live in a low-income area, where 85% of the students get free or reduced school meals. We are also the school for the local American Indian reservation. We are a Kids at Hope school and do many things to give students a positive sense of self and give them the confidence to know they can succeed. \n\nWe could use an iPad in so many ways.  There is a wide variety of apps that apply to the many learning styles and special needs that make up my classroom.  There are multiple apps that would help my special needs students. \nThey think they are just playing games, but in all reality, they are developing different learning abilities and practicing their skills.  Most of these applications will email results to me, but also to the Special Education teacher, as well as parents.  Along with emailed scores from the ""games"", these applications can also pinpoint the students' weaknesses, and also what difficulties I can expect to have with them in daily assignments. \n\nI love finding new and innovate ways to reach my students.   My special needs students would not be the only ones spending time on the iPad.  There are many apps that could make learning fun for my whole class, like multiplication games, for example.  These apps also can also email me the results so I can better track their progress.  \nI know that when the kids have fun and learn at the same time, everybody wins. "

Many of the books in storage have been read in previous classes or will be read in junior high school. We are going to be learning about the roles of Literature Circles and how to read for pleasure. ""The City of Ember"" is the first of a series. It is my hope that some of my reluctant readers will be ignited by this experience and want to continue reading in DuPrau's other books. \nStudents will learn how to make connections to text, identify and create meaning for new and unknown vocabulary, predict, and summarize among other valuable literacy strategies.  \n\nHaving contemporary juvenile and young adult literature will pique my students' interest in a greater way. It's exciting to open an book that is within five years old. This will create more engagement and hopefully a curiosity for more journeys within the pages of other books.  "

I am proud of always having taken each of my young students as far as they have been willing and able to go academically each year while still trying to keep them excited about learning and happy to come to school each day.  However, each year it seems that we spend more time on what used to be considered a first-grade curriculum, while the opportunities for discovery learning through play that WE enjoyed in kindergarten disappear.\n\nI've decided that this is the year that my students WILL have a Dramatic Play center in our classroom in which we can create a house, workshop, doctor's office, theater, or any number of imaginary spaces for pretend play.

My goal is to give my students the best education ever, to make them love READING and to make them very successful through the school year. \n\nMy bilingual students have been struggling with their academic Reading skills. They need to be able to enjoy ""the act of learning,"" and right now they are not achieving at the level I know they can. My students struggle so much with reading because they need to learn in both languages. They do not have any assistance at home due to their parents being unable to speak English and sometimes unable to read in their home language. The major reason why is their non-desire to sit down and read. I'd like to have my classroom Centered Around Reading so that my students can continue to learn and grow academically - but in a new way, a fun and exciting way. A way that makes them WANT TO LEARN! TO ENJOY READING!The key to learning is to disguise it in a fun, hands-on way. \n\nAll of these materials are NON-consumable, so they will be reused year after year.

I am constantly copying information for my students and sending home newsletters.  I print out research for them to use in projects. Our school is out of money for paper and ink and I have already spent over $200 out of pocket. \n\nI have a great group of students this year who deserve the very best! They live in a rural area and they love their school. Our school was built 11 years ago but you would think it is brand new because our students take such good care of it. They are proud of their school and community and deserve to have all the advantages of schools in larger areas. \n\nPaper and ink don't sound like much, do they?  But when teachers are being challenged to teach lessons that prepare our students for the 21st century they need supplies to help with this.  It is difficult to research on the computers we have in our class when you can't print out information. Our school is unable to supply us with paper and ink to keep up with our printing so receiving this through Donor's Choose would give us materials they will use to learn about our world and how to use our technology to find information. \n\nMy long term goal is to provide students with IPads and EReaders.

Their experiences plus Shakespeare's words equals gold in my classroom.  \n\nMy students face daily violence and disempowerment while trying to attend high school in one of the most historically disadvantaged communities in California. Though the community has deep cultural roots, we have yet to see the day when all of the diverse groups on campus pull together to try and create a truly safe educational environment. Still, many of our students hold on to hope, either driven by the realization that there is nowhere else to go but up or because we have a supportive set of teachers and administration who bend over backwards for our kids. Our campus would have been fodder for Shakespeare's next great tragedy, but the smiles that can still be had on different faces on campus means that possibly, we would have made a great comedy as well. Despite the ugly facade of gang violence, shootings, graffiti and disrespect, beneath all of that there are students who truly want an education and a chance. \n\nI am requesting 100 copies of Shakespeare's Othello in which the students can annotate for all the themes and literary elements we study in class. We spent the entire first term trying to gain conceptual understanding of very challenging literary theories, including feminist, postcolonial, Marxist, and psychoanalysis. This approach gives students the best way to connect with the literature we study! With this resource, my students will be able to act out the play's scenes, have a chance at playwriting by revising Shakespeare's original work, gain more confidence in the literary theories they will be expected to know in their freshman college English class next year. The ability to read, analyze and perform Shakespeare is all part of an experience that all students should have. My seniors have yet to have this experience.  \n\nOne hundred students will read and live the words of Shakespeare together. One hundred students will discuss how a conflict of 400 years ago could still be applicable to their lives today. One hundred students will feel like they have met the Gatekeeper to the Literati Club and been able to walk right in. Please help my students grab this feeling and remember it forever. "

With these books I hope to challenge my students to read independently and begin to increase their vocabulary as well. Our state standard is for students to read 25 books this year, I am requiring 30 and I'm even joining in. \n\nStudents will be able to use these books to do reading, elements of a story projects, vocabulary and overall have a sense of having something that belongs to them. I just don't want them to experience reading by themselves, but I hope to take time out to read to my students, giving them an even better chance at becoming better readers. We have a great technology initiative and have electronic options for reading and writing. However, I would like my students to have the option to hold the book, see the words, flag paragraphs and words, therefore, giving different learners even more resources. \n\nI'm just one of many teachers on a quest to make a difference in student learning. I am not against using my own resources as well as help from donors like you. Reading is fundamental and my goal is to get my kids excited about reading.

","The new school year is approaching and I can't wait to meet my new class! Help my students feel welcomed and loved as they enter a new class full of new supplies.  \n\nMy students live in a high poverty area in New York. All students receive free breakfast and lunch. The neighborhood they live in is a tough area for kids to grow up. These students overcome the challenges they are faced every day with the help of their family, peers, and teachers. It is important to me to help these students grow the confidence they need to meet the challenges they face. My students love art projects and small group work. They love and need the one on one attention I try to provide.  \n\nThe materials I requested will help me kick off the new school year. The markers, colored pencils, paper and scissors will help me start the year with some fun art projects. I will also use these supplies throughout the year to enhance the core subjects. Many students are visual learners and art projects help them comprehend the topics. I also requested some classroom supplies such as name tags and fun decorations for the classroom. These materials will help the students feel welcomed as they enter int a new school year. The small easel will help me during my small group work. There are often a few students who are confused about a topic and I bring them to the back table to work in a small group. The easel will help me explain the topic to them.  \n\nPlease help me to supply my students with materials they can use throughout the school year. It is very important to me to offer my students a welcoming environment and to use different ways to help them to learn.  "

We are at a Charter School and I have an inclusion classroom, meaning a large portion of my classroom has been diagnosed with special needs. The needs of each student vary greatly, but with these literacy supplies I will be able to reach their needs and they will be aided in reaching their goals more efficiently and effectively, as each child has goals that need to be met both on a daily basis and yearly. Special needs students benefit from multiple teaching techniques and with the listening and hands on centers I know they will find success. Being at a Charter School, funding is not always readily available, so without DonorsChoose, we would have to go without these wonderful materials.. \n\nWith these supplies the students will be able to study and sharpen their literacy skills. The listening center will help reach those students who benefit from an auditory stimulus. The chalkboards, pipe cleaners and alphabet tiles are a great way to study their spelling and vocabulary words in a hands on manner. The Reusable Write and Wipe Pockets will be great in limiting the amount of paper we use as we are a Green school and the students will enjoy writing with the dry erase marker as they complete assignments at the Comprehension Center. Last but not least, with the book rack, we are able to keep our weekly reads in one safe and organized spot. All of these materials will be set up around my classroom as centers that the students will visit and I know with these great materials they will look forward to our literacy blocks everyday. \n\nThe donors that support this project will be doing much more than donating to a good cause. Donors that donate to this project will be changing the future of every student in my classroom. These donors will open up a door for all of my students, they will serve as pilots, travel agents and dream catchers. Students who learn a love of reading can travel all over the world, have any profession they want and go on true adventures. Donors will be making a bigger impact than ever imagined! "

My job is to keep them excited about school while I teach them about everything. Remember that everything you really need to know you learn in kindergarten. My students are always fascinated when we begin our unit on money. They think they are all grown-up when they get to use money. Before they can learn about money, my students must first have basic number skills under control. \n\nI am requesting materials such as the Fun to Count to 10, the Fun to Count to 20, and the Fun to Count to 30 games to help my students practice basic number concepts.  I am requesting the Let's Compare Numbers games so my students can develop an awareness of more and less.  The addition machines and the subtraction machines will help my students practice and learn basic math facts. I am requesting the Let's Go Shopping games because once we understand basic number concepts we can build on these concepts. Learning about money is easy when we have fun games like Let's Go Shopping to help us. \n\nIn order for my children to be financially literate, they need a good start in kindergarten.

Often the young students get overlooked when new equipment is purchased. Please help us!\n\n \n\nThese 5 and 6 year old students attend a full day kindergarten program. This building houses preschool through 5th grade and is the only elementary school in our district. We are outside the metropolitan area and considered a bit more rural. The students and families are open to new and different activities and supplemental teaching materials. The budget, however, does not allow us to provide those opportunities. \n\nLearning to read, practicing addition and subtraction, communicating with a far-off pen pal, listening to and watching vivid stories are all things that the Kindle Fire tablets will enable these students to participate in. Their love of learning and ability to absorb new information combined with new technology would be a wonderful fit. Our current technology doesn't support the curriculum we have and the students are unable to supplement their learning. Working with the available applications the Kindle supports during center time and small group time will give the kids a wonderful chance to listen to authors read their own stories, practice sight words and math facts, and reinforce common core standards taught in the classroom. Unfortunately we are limited with our mobility because we can't carry them around without cases. \n\nThe Kindle Fire HD tablets in the hands of young learners will not only reinforce the skills taught in the classroom, it will help each one become an independent learner. It will help provide a more effective curriculum and help each child, each family, to become more confident in the ability of the kindergarten student to use provided technology effectively and responsibly.

Now, with new advanced materials, the wonderful art of printmaking can be taught with ease and no cut fingers! \n\nI am fortunate to teach high school students who have been identified as talented/gifted in art. I teach at a small high school in Louisiana. We have a strong art department, but our budget does not allow for any art enrichment supplies. Most of my students come from low income families, and are unable to purchase extra art supplies. My students are passionate learners, hungry for new artistic experiences. They approach each new project with excitement and dedication. \n\nPrintmaking has always been one of my passions. I minored in it in college, and love teaching the technique.It \nis the process of making artworks created by carving or cutting a single hard surface, then printing the image on paper. Linoleum printing, also known as relief printing, used to be taught by many art teachers, myself included. The problem came when students used very sharp cutters to carve images into the linoleum. The linoleum has a very slippery surface, so there were always dangerous slips, and cut fingers. It was so scary that I stopped teaching the technique. Now, with the advent of new materials, it is possible to teach relief printing with a minimum of risks. The new plate materials are very soft, making them much easier to cut. The art of printmaking allows students to create multiple prints from a single image. This is a process that builds on their knowledge of mirror-imagery, composition, and positive/negative space. \n\nIn Louisiana, our public schools do not have the money to fund art enrichment projects. My students take the study of art very seriously. It breaks my heart when I am unable, because of a lack of funding, to share advanced techniques with my amazing students. Your funding of this project would provide a truly memorable art experience. It would indeed be a ""relief"" to once again be able to teach relief printing. Thank you for your consideration. "

With hundreds of apps available, I will be able to continue providing great therapy in a way that is motivating and time efficient.  I am looking for a way to optimize therapy time and I know an iPad will help. I  wrote my thesis on the use of iPads in therapy during graduate school and found that they are very effective. Unfortunately, the iPad I was using to collect data during therapy was property of the University so I had to return it upon graduation. I know that each of my students will benefit from the iPad and will be able to move toward their IEP goals more quickly!  \n\nWith a caseload of close to 60 students, my day is full with therapy. During my weekly prep time, I am typically pulled in to IEP meetings. I did research with iPads and speech therapy in graduate school and found that they make for a very efficient and effective way to provide therapy.  This iPad will be used daily for years to come.

What classes inspired you to choose your career?  Hands-on science experiments about electricity will help my students learn and may inspire them to become electrical engineers. \n\nMy students, in a rural area of West Virginia, do not have many opportunities to visit science centers where they may do hands-on experiments. Their families often are economically disadvantaged and are not able to provide the science kits and toys that other children have. Yet, they are still eager to learn.  They thrive when allowed to learn through kinesthetic and tactile activities. \n\nBy providing these students with the Snap Circuit Electrical kits, they will be able to actually create what they would otherwise only be able to read about in a text book.  There are 101 different projects that students can create.  Students will be able to make open circuits and closed circuits.  There are lessons about transistors, resistors, and capacitors.  Students will be able to demonstrate practical applications by creating lights, fans, and motion detector buzzers. \n\nThis project is most important for those students who could have been electrical engineers or could have been electricians if they had only seen that as a possibility.  If they had only known that was an option and had been inspired through that hands-on science experiment to follow that dream. "

Pre-K to 2nd grade are the foundational years for literacy. The skills you obtain in early elementary school can make or break a student's future academic growth. \n\nMy colleagues and I teach students in a low-income New Orleans community slowly rebuilding itself post-Hurricane Katrina. Although most of our students were born just before or just after Katrina, their lives have nonetheless been significantly affected by it -- many of their families' homes were lost in the storm and the education system in their city was turned upside down. Although almost all of our students are coming in at prekindergarten or non-reading levels, we have an exciting opportunity to close this gap early on in their academic careers and expose them to the wonderful world of books.\n\nMany of our students came to our school as non-readers, meaning they did not even correlate letters to the sounds that they make. With hard work and effort most of our classes are now reading on-level! \n\nMost of our students struggle with not their decoding abilities, but with their ability to higher level themes and ideas in texts. In order to encourage the development of these higher level comprehension skills, my colleagues and I have developed a set of comprehensive Read Aloud plans. These plans cover units that spiral back to skills covered from Pre-Kindergarten through 2nd grade. Our goal is to introduce our students to a range of topics including: main characters, setting, author's point of view, problem and solution, comparing and contrasting texts, inferences and predictions, etc. Our only problem: We do not have the books we need to see these Read Aloud plans come to fruition. \nThere are 2-3 teachers for each grade level at our school. Between borrowing each others' texts and making trips to the library we still seem to come up short. Teachers have to cut their rigorous lesson plans due to a lack of text choice. We have realized that we need a Read Aloud library. My students need 3 sets of 60 book titles including Green Eggs and Ham, Where the Wild Things Are, and The Very Hungry Caterpillar to read during our Read Aloud block.\n\nIf we can introduce these skills during our Read Aloud block we will be able to guide our students through the necessary pathways of reading comprehension in order to better help them achieve literacy success. If our students can connect with ideas in texts in a whole group setting, then when reading independently our students will be better able to comprehend books on their own. With your help we could make this Read Aloud library, and higher order thinking, a reality for our students! "

I teach 18 pre-kindergarten children at Ross Elementary School, and I want my children to say something nice about the outdoors.  \n\nOur school is situated in the Dupont Circle neighborhood, surrounded by pollution, noisy and dirty streets, and very little wildlife or trees.  The school's population is very diverse, and the majority of the parents both work, sometimes two jobs.  77% of our students receive free or reduced lunch, and 67% use English as their second language.  Any planned field trip is fully funded by the parents, which makes it difficult since some families have three or four children attending Ross.  These children need many chances to experience new places without a time restriction, and instead with time to look, feel, and smell a place different their familiar surroundings.\n\nThe Audubon Naturalist Society offers hand-on nature programs, and they are designed to complement the environmental education efforts in the classroom.  These activity-oriented programs led by trained naturalists incorporate role-playing, explorations, hunts, data collection, and other activities to provide an educational experience driven by the children's own natural curiosity.  \n\nThe progran Nature in Winter will guide my students in exploring the woods and fields in Woodend, a 40-acre nature sanctuary.  Students will look for signs of animal activity and clues to the life cycles of trees and other plants.  \n\nThis field trip will take place during the winter months, thus enabling my students to compare life in the cold months to life in the warm season.  This field trip incorporates the DCPS Science Standards: Unit A- Life Science Unit. \n\nThe cost of this proposal would include the bus transportation, program fee, individual sticker books, two disposable cameras plus developing, film for a movie camera, and four classroom books for the classroom library.  \n\nThis field trip would enable my students to leave their ""old environment"" and visit a ""new environment,"" one that is fresh, healthy, and full of learning.  They will be able to say nice things about life in the woods and the animals that inhabit this world with them. "

And when they are happy, they learn.  I am continuously amazed by my students' creativity when they are able to relax and have fun.  Unfortunately, our school is low income and therefore our supplies are very limited. \n\nI will use these materials to incorporate more fun activities in my classroom.

My students have hard lives, they need to have fun while they are in school.  Furthermore, I see my students learn so much more through games and fun activities, rather than worksheets and textbooks.  The lessons that can be learned through interactive play are endless.

The higher achieving students are also at risk, because they claim they do not have time to read.  All of my students, regardless of reading level or reading ""attitude"" need books to help them be successful in English class and in every other class they take. \n\nMy hope is that with a more varied classroom library than I am able to provide on my own, my students will experiment with new genres, will share books with one another, and will find the books that help them become the people they want to be.  The books will absolutely be a gateway to higher test scores, but more than that, these books will be a gateway to new opportunities.  Studies show that schools that have classroom libraries have students that better utilize school and public libraries.  So really, by investing in a few books, we are opening many doors for these children to be lifelong learners and more engaged citizens.  I also believe (because I have seen it happen) that students will soon apply the concepts we are studying to their independent reading books. \n\nYour donations will change lives, broaden horizons, and help to make a small classroom library a gathering place for students where we can exchange ideas, travel to new places, explore complex feelings, and think about social change.

Our group of students want to start recycling. \n\nOur school is a large urban  public elementary school. It is a magnet school, so our students are bused or driven from many parts of the city. 72% of our students come from a low socioeconomic setting.  Due to bus scheduling conflicts, our school day does not begin until 8:45 AM. Because many parents need to get to work earlier, some have been dropping off their children as early as 7:30. To accommodate for this, we started a before-school environmental club so our students can be engaged in meaningful activity while they wait for school to begin. \n\nWe are requesting recycling bins for each classroom. Some of the classrooms are already equipped, but many are not. The students are learning about the effects of pollution and recycling on our planet. They have been reading articles and watching films about how recycling works, and how they can have a positive impact on the earth. The students are working as Earth Ambassadors to create an effective recycling program for our school. We already have some recycling occurring, but the students and faculty as a whole are not aware  of what can be recycled and how it can be recycled. The students will teach each classroom about what paper products can be recycled. At the end of the day, they will take turns collecting the recycled paper for the custodial staff to dispose of properly. \n\nOur project will make a difference because we can first educate the students on the benefits of recycling. They can see how they can make a difference in a large urban environment. And, it is creating ecology-minded youth. "

Hearing books on CD can help the book come alive while enabling the listener to hear fluid vivid expression. However the problem with using a CD player is that there is only one story playing at one time. With iPods we can customize each device as well as taping the teachers voice for the children to listen to. \n\nIn the past I have opted out of using listening stations for a couple of reasons.  One being that there is only one story read at a time. Secondly, students will come and go during stations leaving them feeling out of place and not finished.  With iPods they can come and go at their leisure, listening and stopping when they need to without interrupting any other students learning.

Art is an important subject that must be taught and we must provide our students with the necessary supplies. \n\nChildren are wonderful artists.  They have the ability to create masterpieces because they do not worry about being perfect. My students love to learn about and create art.  However, they need basic materials like paint to be able to continue to create their own art. A lot of our students qualify for free or reduced lunch.  They do not have the resources to attend afterschool programs that will teach and expose them to art. They need to have art instruction in school. \n\nProviding our students with simple art supplies including brushes and paints will provide them with the opportunity to continue to create beautiful masterpieces and express themselves.  These supplies will provide the students with the resources they need to learn about and produce art. \n\nEvery child has different strengths and interests that need to be fostered to help them succeed. It is not fair for a child who is interested in art to never be exposed to the art curriculum because of budget cuts. Every child deserves a high-quality education in ALL subject areas. "

The waiting and anticipation of it when you finally got your turn.  One of my students got that opportunity recently.  She chose out of our classroom treasure box a stylus pen that my husband had recently brought home from a business trip.  She went straight for the stylus and asked me what kind of pen this was.  I told her it was for a Pad or tablet.  She looked at me and I asked if she had one.  She said no but she still wanted it and so did the other kids. In that simple answer I found out that in our small community school many kids only experience with technology outside of the television, some kind of video games,  and cell phone was at school. They look forward to coming to school because it is their home away from home. So this project is direct inspiration from that student.  \n\nMy students will be able to take AR quizzes, experience books, use math manipulative's on line, complete assignments, and much, much more with the I pad.   Best of all, it will allow them to use the technology that is being used everyday in the world around them.  \n\nWe will have an I pad in the classroom to give them something to use those free stylus pens on.  It will enhance their learning through technology and prepare them for the future that holds many more open doors than they expected.  "

Information will be retained if students have fun while they are learning and these resources will allow them to do that. \n\nBy supplying my class with literacy centers, you will help them become excited about reading and writing. Student interest and desire to read and write will grow exponentially!  The additional resources will help my students become more confident and proficient in these subject areas. "

The children coming into my Kindergarten classroom in September will be so delighted that you did.  They may not know it yet, but they are in for a year of tremendous learning and excitement.  One of the core areas that is taught in the very important Kindergarten years is the letter names and sounds (the good old ABC's).  Unfortunately we do not have the skills practice that is necessary to give the students the visual, kinesthetic, and repetitive support they need.  This is done very well through skills practice books (workbooks).  \n\nI am starting my eighth year at P.S.8, located in the heart of the Washington Heights community.  This community is made up of mostly Hispanic families with English being the second language.  Due to the fact that many of my children come into my classroom with minimum English experience, it is even more vital that they have many experiences with the language and they practice not only in school but at home with the letter names and sounds.  This foundation is necessary for the children to move on to reading and writing.\n\nI have been formally trained in the Orton-Gillingham approach to teaching reading, writing, and spelling.  This approach has made a great impact on my students.  However, we are missing essential resources such as workbooks, manipulatives, learning centers and visuals.  \n\nWe are asking for your help and support to fund games, visuals, and centers that the children can work in independently.   Thank you in advance for your consideration.\n"

Foldables help students organize important information into a student friendly format.  \n\nMy students come from very diverse backgrounds.  Being located in a military community, it is not uncommon for students to come halfway through the year or leave halfway though the year.  They face the challenges of frequently switching schools due to the transient nature of the military. Often times, one or both parents are away for extended periods and students may have limited help with homework at home. This is why foldables are especially useful.  \n\nStudents will be using the materials requested to create foldables within the class notes.  Foldables create a student friendly way for students to organize notes, examples and class information that can easily be referred to at later times.  The foldable acts as a more interactive way to store and use notes.  \n\nFlipbooks and foldables will provide a tangible and interactive resource for students to use.  When students utilize flipbooks and foldables, they are helping themselves to solve a particular problem instead of just asking someone to show them how to do it.  My students learn independence and how to help themselves.  When students create foldables, they create a sense of ownership over the material within the foldable.  "

They are inspired to think critically and create on a daily basis, putting theory into action and forging our future. \n\nOur school is nestled in the foothills of Appalachia Ohio.  An area once rich in manufacturing and industry, now sees the majority of it's citizens flocking to the city for jobs. With a per capita income of under $17,000, our city is in great need of a resurgence in these lost jobs. Our students represent this hard-working, blue collar demographic that most have only read about. They are determined to make a better future for themselves, their families, and their hometown. Our high school is at the forefront of this movement. We are in a continuous effort to bring new technology and teaching methods into the school. We are rich in technology, thanks to a staff and administration that have worked hard to secure numerous grants over the years. \n\nI am requesting 1 MakerBot 3D Printer Bundle so they can turn ideas into reality. Students are currently learning about how the designed world works and that nearly everything they use has been engineered. They learn sketching, technical drawing, and 3D CAD software. Teaching students the importance of design and engineering can be difficult for some when they can't physically see what they have made. By securing a MakerBot, my students will be able to take the 3D designs they have created and make them a reality. We plan on making everything from assistive devices for the handicapped students in our school to replacement parts in student's cars. I would also like to build a partnership with local businesses that would allow us to print hard to find parts or prototypes they may need that would usually be outsourced. Having the capability to 3D print our imagination will provide relevance to the rigor in the classroom. \n\nSuccessful funding of this project will allow my students to engineer their own future. The experience gained from designing and printing their ideas will inspire many to pursue the unknown. That unknown a could be a high-tech job, technical school, or an engineering college. I want my students to see that they are at the cutting edge and have the skills and experience to pursue their future, whatever it may be. "

Because the non-academic needs are so great, plenty of time must be taken to give students the basics with the hope that with food, clothing and nurturing care, the learning will come.  Teaching these kids requires as many effective, creative tools as possible. In our classroom, most students do not have much, if any, experience with computers.  To be able to print the students' hard work will allow them to touch the product of their effort and will give them something to take home to share with their families. \n\nIn our classroom, we utilize computers for numerous literacy activities. Currently, once the work has been completed, it vanishes back into the computer, gone, but for a ""completed"" notation in the record-keeping page of the program.  While learning does take place, there is a missed opportunity to put the work into the hands of the student. \n\nUsing the computer is a real treat for my students. The ""fun"" of the educational programs they work on are powerful motivators for the kids to learn and practice important skills.  Printing samples of student work completed on the computer would provide a more tangible ""reward"" for their work.  It would be so valuable to be able to give each student a physical document, showing what was learned.  Another benefit is to reinforce what has been learned by the student by giving them something to take home to share with their family.  The student could ""read"" their paper to the family, providing the additional practice on the skill while building family involvement in the learning process. \n\nFinally, so much of learning stems from enthusiasm, desire and effort.  Teachers continually search for ways to inspire these qualities in students.  Your kind support will help me to increase enthusiasm and desire to learn. It will give me one more tool to encourage students to put forth their greatest effort which will help them succeed academically and in life."

I want to have a positive impact on my students' health by modeling a healthy lifestyle that includes daily exercise. \n\nWith these dumbbells, students will be able to learn and perform dumbbell exercises they will be able to do throughout their lives.  Weight training exercises strengthen muscles, which in turn helps to burn more calories and protect against bone loss and certain diseases.  Dumbbells are ideal for such training because they can be light, are easy to use, and can work all muscle groups.  Here are several reasons students should exercise with weights: they can achieve stronger muscles, stronger bones, stronger tendons and ligaments, more muscle, less fat, higher metabolism, greater physical capacity, greater self-confidence, and they can lower injury risk. \n\nChildren need to be encouraged to have an active lifestyle. In the past, childhood was the most active time in people's lives, but today's children tend to be preoccupied with inactive pastimes and few do enough resistance exercise to develop strong musculoskeletal systems. Research confirms that sensible strength training will help children look better, feel better and function better, as well as develop an activity pattern that should serve them well throughout their lives.

There are about 220 eighth graders at our school.  My students are amazing!  Many of my students have ADD or a learning disability and this makes paying attention in a social studies class very difficult.  However, they try as best they can. The majority of my students are from homes where English is the second language. \n\nThese exercise balls will turn around the learning in my classroom.  The students will be using more than one portion of the brain while sitting in class and taking notes.  Studies have shown that the more parts of the brain that are engaged while a student is learning new information, the greater chance there is for knowledge retention.  By having the students' physical bodies actively engaged while we are discussing the American Revolution, or the United States Constitution, the students will be able to remember, analyze and improve classroom discussion.  \nThe off task activities that happen in the classroom will also reduce to an absolute minimum if not disappear altogether.  Studies have shown that students with ADD or ADHD who are allowed to bounce on an exercise ball get up less often to go to the restroom or get a drink of water. Sydney Zentall PhD at Purdue University discovered in her studies that doing two things at once forces the brain to focus on the primary task. \n\nThese exercise balls will greatly improve the learning environment for my students.  They will be able to sit at the table and focus on their task and be able to complete it on time.  This will not only improve their grades, but will help them in retaining what they are learning.  As a result, their state test scores should improve as well as the connections they make between my class and reading. math or science. "

AVID is designed to identify kids ""in the middle"" who are in danger of not successfully qualifying for college for a variety of reasons.  For some, their parents didn't attend college, don't understand its importance, or couldn't afford to send them without scholarships.  (Many AVID seniors qualify for academic scholarships.) For others, their lack of good work and study habits is holding them back.  AVID teaches good note-taking skills, binder organization skills, and provides class time tutoring with AVID trained college students.  It is an exceptionally worthy program. \n\nThe Last Lecture is part of a unit of study for the 8th grade AVID students in our district.

Now our students are much more technologically advanced then what most schools can provide, due to funding. \n\nLast school year I had 23 students who are bright and eager to learn. They love coming to school and learning new information. Most are able to work cooperatively together. A fourth of the class are English Language Learners. Seven receive speech and other special help outside the classroom and nine receive academic intervention. Most of my students helped each other and when they did not understand something they felt comfortable enough to ask questions or ask for the lesson/activity to be re-explained in another way. Not all my students process information in the same way or at the same time and because of their needs I do a lot of redirecting, re-teaching and differentiating of centers and activities. My students taught me how to enjoy every progress made no matter how small or grand. This upcoming year I will have a similar group dynamic. \n\nIn there homes, students have devices that give them instant gratification; TV, video games, etc. While in the classroom, we might have a computer and share a smart board with other classrooms. \nSchool budgets are getting smaller, therefore there is a severe need for technology in our classrooms. Textbooks, pencils and paper are no longer enough. As teachers we try to make the most of what we have and buy what we can to supplement our classroom in order to engage our students. I imagine having six or more tablets with certain educational apps that would reinforce the learning that happens in my classroom. The tablets will be more then a center. They would complete the collaboration between the teacher, lessons and technology that will facilitate my students learning. I can see my students listening to a story, working on letter sound correlation, grouping letters and sounds to create words, working with rhymes, working on math skills, listening to or reading a book, and so much more. \n\nImagine how excited you got when you upgrade to the latest gadget, you quickly learn the in and outs of it and cannot wait to show someone what you learned. Now imagine how a student might feel learning with a tablet. I see their minds opening up to new possibilities with no worries of their deficiencies. Students are able to retain a greater deal of information when technology is added to the learning process. Technology adds to the fun of learning. Thank you. "

The iPad will be the central tool used in our ""Research Center"". It will be what the Research Team turns to when delving deep into their topic. However, because of its portability they could easily take it with them to the library, expanding their research resources or use it on in-field expeditions and fieldtrips.  \n\n This piece of technology will certainly motivate and engage the teams.We will establish a culture of inquiry, promote critical thinking, strengthen teamwork skills, and feel so proud when we are able to demonstrate to the other members of our classroom family how our exploration has yielded great wisdom and growth!

Then they will review their recording, making notes on the video about what could change to make it better; how their intonation or speed could improve, does their voice convey meaning, etc...\nThese videos will be saved on a specific desktop computer--each student will have a folder in which to save them.  We will have an ongoing digital file of each student's reading progress throughout the year.

Our school is on probation, so the school's discretionary funds must be spent on after school reading programs, leaving less this year to spend on art supplies. \n\nOur school's budget for art supplies can only cover 1 sculpture project per year, and my students are eager to create 3-d objects and try a project beyond strictly drawing assignments.  This grant will provide one of the four Art 1 classes I teach with a sculpture project that I have done with students in the past, and I know that they will enjoy it and experience more of the joy of art.  Our classes are large, 33-39, but because the students' behavior is excellent, I know they can handle this project.  I hope you will help them to have an interesting sculpture project! \n\nSo I am asking for plaster of paris, sand, plastic containers to hold the sand, air hardening clay which we will form into totem poles, and then press the totem poles into the sand, which creates the cavity into which the plaster will be poured.  Finally, I am asking for sets of tempera paint with which to paint both the plaster and the air hardened clay.  This will teach students directly through experience what it means to work with an open face mold, what a totem pole is and the meaning of one; also, it will teach the students how to work with clay, which is an item we can't provide for the Art I classes, and which many have requested.  It also will teach students about the timing involved when working with plaster of paris:  it must be poured quickly after mixing the dry powder with water, or else it will harden in the mixing bowl! \n\nI believe my students are a good investment on which to spend your donation dollars, because I see good behavior everyday. Also, in the past 4 years, our school has raised its reading and writing and math scores to the point where our school is in the running to be removed from the probation list.  Our school this year has also made huge strides in upping the attendance statistics, and this is another reflection of the innate goodness of my students.  My kids are poor only in the financial sense, but rich in other ways-- very willing to do the assignments in art, show up for class, and they will cherish having a sculpture project!  Thank you for your time in reading my project."

We have been fortunate enough to receive a grant for Lucy Calkins' renowned Writer's Workshop curriculum, which will be implemented in my classroom for the first time ever this fall. However, this wonderful curriculum requires a number of supplemental materials that my school simply does not have the capacity to acquire in these tight financial times.  \n\nIn order to make Writer's Workshop a truly magical and therapeutic experience for my students, we need a variety of supplies to supplement Calkins' curriculum.

With your generous assistance, my students will be able to share their important personal narratives with others in our school, in their families, and in the broader community."

Use of dances from other cultures will also enhance our Social Studies Curriculum by exposing students to the different cultures within their own neighborhood. This portable ipod speaker will also allow us to finally include music with the use of our class parachute during physical education. \n\nDonations to our project will bring the arts and physical activity back into the school for these children. With the current financial crisis, cuts to arts and physical education have left these children without access to a well-rounded education.

They cherish every fieldtrip opportunity to visit new and exciting places they wouldn't otherwise be able to visit. They also relish sharing these experiences with their parents and siblings. Unfortunately, they lack the financial means to purchase a reliable digital camera to bring on the trips. Therefore, purchasing this camera for our class will enable my students to capture these special moments through their eyes.\n\nHaving the opportunity to return to school and share all of their experiences and retell their stories using their photos will be priceless. \n\nA great percentage of my students have never been on a boat and this experience will be engraved in their memory forever. Having a digital camera for them to actually take the pictures would be spectacular.  This will help us discuss and reinforce key concepts as a class after the trip.  Also, it will make it easier for them to share these experiences with their parents, who may not be familiar with the places we will visit. However, this is not the only reason why we are requesting a digital camera.  \n\nMy students will also use the camera to document their learning in various ways. Students will use the camera for their research projects, presentations of their research projects, acting out vocabulary words, and for our other educational field trips. I would like to expose my students to the power of photography and visual arts. \n\nCapturing special moments on our field trips from a student's point of view will empower them and engage them in the learning process.

Many young adults lack map skills, knowledge of the world around them, are unable to connect to current disasters, or unsure of what career to choose. \n\nThe students from my classroom work in a Title I school. This means most students received either reduced price or free lunch based on their parents' income.  Currently, fifteen out of seventeen students in my classroom receive free or reduced price lunch.  Specifically, over 75% of my students are working below level in one or more subject areas.  My classroom consists of ELL (8/17), previously retained (9/17), identified SLD (5/17), or working with an attendance intervention (4/17) or 504 plan (2/17). Although our high school graduation rate for our school district has been increasing, the average age for graduation has increased, too.  If these children do not have a goal or ideas of where to head next, we will have more young adults unable to contribute to our society.  I want to know that when the students leave my room that they know what they want to be and how to do it. \n\nI received Time 4 Kids in 2012 for the 2013 school year. It was one of the best resources that I have received through Donorschoose. I used it to supplement my reading instruction. We used their virtual Interactive Digital Editions to use on my whiteboard. I used the guide that featured helpful ideas from real teachers. This doesn't include the how much my students loved to read and take home their magazines to show their family. We learned about maps, countries, continents, history, current events, new vocabulary, graphs, problems happening in poverty-stricken countries, inspiring students that have heart of service, inventors, etc. When getting their new magazines, they would ""oo"" and ""ah"" over the photographs while discussing the captions. In addition, I used it to aid my reading instruction by focusing on comprehension, text features, connections, comparisons, etc. The possibilities are endless.  \nMy students need current news and nonfiction text (Time 4 Kids , SuperScience and Scholastic) to teach them about map skills, compare and contrast, philanthropy, and careers.\n\nSome of my students will never see the outside of this city.

You wouldn't have to say a word because your face would say it all, ""What am I supposed to do with this?"" Students today face the same struggle. They are a digital generation but schools are slow to cater. \n\nMy sixth grade Language Arts is a hodgepodge of diversity and skill. This is has a reputation for accepting the students that other schools don't know how to deal with. Here they find sanctuary and we strive to reach them on their level. We offer dual language programs, a variety of sports and book clubs, and the basic core curriculum. The school also doubles as a Chinese School on Saturdays where a few of my student's relatives attend. We believe very strongly in building community. Many of our students walk or ride their bikes to school because of the proximity to the residential areas. Because our students come from many backgrounds, they bring their own passions to the classroom. Some of them read in their native language while others are trying to learn a new one. Some eat food that other children have never seen while others listen to music that hasn't become popular yet in North Carolina. They are a normal teenage bunch, passionate, excited, and ready for what the world holds. \n\nA LCD projector and adapter that I could use on a daily basis would change the student's learning from a classroom environment to a world environment. With a projector we could Skype classrooms around the state, country, and world so that students could see they are global learners. We could practice many skills at once, correcting sentences while using word processing skills on Word. When teaching skills to my students, I could create multimedia presentations that would engage students and make them active learners. They could create their own presentations and present them to the class, sharing their knowledge and experiences with the class. Social media, cell phones, and iPods have changed the lives of our students. If we were able to reach them using their own technology, students would want to be involved in the classroom because it will look and feel like their world. Students will learn that school is not time machine but a look into the future and a place to ignite their passion. \n\nAs I look around my classroom, I see the faces of our future. My goal is to prepare these students with not only a basis of the English language, but with the ability to read between the lines, ask the tough questions, and seek answers. To do that we need the equipment that they will be using. I heard a statistic that 70% of the jobs that these students will be working in the future have not been invented yet. If we can provide these students with some technology, we will bring success. "

The inflection, tone, and dramatization of the narrator helps readers. \n\nThere are many uses for audio books in a school setting, but the most prominent use in our school is for independent reading. Students listen to the audio books and read along with a copy of the book.\nTo illustrate the benefits of using audio books with students, let me tell you about “Johnny,” one of our struggling students from last year.  He was reading at a 3rd grade reading level and chose to read ""Among the Hidden,"" which was just about his level with an audio book. He was so proud of himself and the audios gave him the confidence to keep on reading. \n\nWhile our library has a modest collection of audio books, we do not have all the necessary equipment to make this a successful program.  We have cassette players with headphones (Walkman), but we do not have CD players for students to listen to them on their own (discman).   \n\nTherefore, I’m requesting 10 CD “discman” for student use.\n\nI would like to have batteries at hand for the students.\n\nIn addition, I would like to utilize the public library’s collection of free downloadable audio books and/or to purchase downloadable audio books for our library, but need 12 MP3 players to lend out to the students. \n\nFinally, I would like to embrace new formats.  Playaways are audio books and players that come together as one device.  The audio book, earphones, and batteries are packaged together for convenient one-stop shopping.  Recorded books offers the playaways bundled together with the read-a-long book. I would like to order a few high-interest titles to supplement our classic heavy collection. \n\nFunding this proposal will empower many struggling readers and allow them to learn to love literature and reading.\n\nThank you for your consideration."

The listening center activities, matching and sorting sets will provide a wide variety of center activities. It will enable centers to be rotated more often.  Social interaction is also important part of kindergarten as well.  The blocks and kitchen playsets will give my students the opportunity for creative play and problem solving. \n\nI face the challenge of catching my students up to their peers in other districts.

Girls are great talkers and in our single gender classroom, discussing and exchanging ideas is encouraged. We also like to listen to stories and play interactive learning games using our SmartBoard, which can prove challenging when others are talking or need to work quietly. \n\n""There is no tool for development more effective than the teaching of girls and the empowerment of women""  UN Secretary General Koffi Annan stated. As an all girls classroom teacher, I seek to teach and empower 20 first grade girls. They come from assorted backgrounds with various family dynamics, and yet, when they enter our classroom, we become one family- accepting our differences, supporting our successes, and encouraging each other. \n\nFirst graders learn best when they can manipulate with their hands, interacting with their learning even in this digital age. What were once magnetic letters on a dry erase board, have now become touch screen letters on a SmartBoard Screen. We are able to access web sites where favorite authors read beloved books, and we can record our own voices reading as the words flash on the screen. Having a set of 6 wireless headsets will enable my class to utilize this fascinating technology without disrupting other students who are working with me or independently at their desks. The headsets will provide an engaging, meaningful way for my students to become active learners, empowering their independence from me. \n\nThink of a time when you learned something. What were you doing? Were you to enter my classroom, I would want you to see 20 little girls learning by moving about the room, visiting different stations, manipulating puzzles, computers, creating visual responses, discussing story elements with a classmate, and reading/listening to books. Wireless headsets will allow us to use our classroom technology to become actively engaged learners while respecting the needs of those who need to work quietly. "

My diverse population of students will more than relate to his stories! They will be with Peter as he explores his Snowy Day. They will find they are not alone as Peter adjusts to his new sibling in Peter's Chair.  \nMr. Putter & Tabby books lure the reader to read on as the lonely, grandfatherly character and his cat, Tabby, share experiences.  The books allow children to use inference skills and imagery without being aware it is happening. The books span across reading levels and children want to read them all! \n\nMy project is important because reading ability is the key to all other education. If a child learns to love to read, and has multiple opportunities to do so, chances are excellent that a life-long-learner will be born!  Having a great collection in the classroom makes it possible for all children to read multiple books. It allows book talks by and among children. I love growing readers! I am thrilled when I see the signs! Loving to read and learn is a life-long habit starting early in school! "

I need to bring these ideas to life before their eyes, and these kits will allow me to do just that.  In literacy, some of my students need to work on sounding out words and spelling, but pencil grip and lack of writing skills stand in their way.

Hence, I'm in need of a document camera.\n\nWhy a document camera and not an overhead project?  Here's why:\n-Overhead transparancies are expensive and take time to create.  A document camera allows you to put the item you wish to project underneath the camera lens so that you can reveal the document immediately.\n-Overhead transparancies require messy markers.  With a document camera, you can use any type of writing implement since you're writing on paper.\n-Overhead projectors only show off transparent objects.  A document camera can project any solid figure on to a screen.\n\nA document camera will help my students gain an understanding of how to use math materials, since they'll be able to develop a deeper understanding of mathematical concepts and will be able to see ALL of the demonstrations I perform on the overhead screen regardless of where they sit in the classroom.  Additionally, I'll be able to post my students' writing immediately so as to use it as a demonstration text during Writing Workshops.

As struggling readers, my students need to read an engaging book and work to discuss the ideas and themes of the novel through personal expression rather than multiple choice comprehension checks.   \n\nMy students are something special.  Each student has their own unique story of overcoming and pressing forward that exceeds any challenges I have faced.  The students at our school want to learn but many have lost the spark that makes education meaningful and fun.  As high school students, many know that college is no longer just an option, but is now a necessity.  However, many are struggling readers and this makes it difficult for them to imagine being successful in a college setting.  In the years to come, our staff is working to prepare these students for the challenge of college and career so each one can be successful!\nIn the past year, their school was the second worst in the city.  Because of this, the school was chosen for turnaround assistance and this year it will have a brand new administration and teaching staff.  As part of this turnaround staff, I'm so excited to bring these wonderful students the educational spark that has been missing in the classrooms for far too many years.  \n\nOne of the most important parts of an active, rigorous, and engaging lesson is making sure to check that students have learned the information-- we call this checking for understanding.  Without this vital step, teachers press forward without ensuring that all students have mastered the information.  \n\nWhiteboards for each student allows for quick checks for understanding.  The teacher can ask a quick question and the students record their answers on the board and then hold them up for a check.  If the students have all answered correctly, the teacher knows they can move on.  If students have not all answered correctly, the teacher can use different strategies including peer-teach to reinforce the material and make sure that each student understands.  \n\nReading is an important component to all content areas in high school.  Our class will read The Giver and record personal reactions on whiteboards as we read.  This will help build literacy skills vital to college success.  \n\n \n\nOur school has been forgotten over the past thirty years.  In the 2010-2011 school year, it is our goal as a new staff to change this.  Every student deserves a quality education and it is our goal to now deliver this to our high school students.  In order to do this, with state budgets being cut daily, we look to the national and local community for assistance.  It takes a village to raise and teach a child. Be a part of our village! Students are the future of America and the World. "

My classroom consists of 7 students with Autism who have varying abilities and range in age from 4-8 years old.

Two of my students are verbal, with the rest communicating through pictures and augmentative devices. \n\nI recently received two new students in my classroom expanding the wide range of skills and needs that my students have.

I have tried my best to create a structured learning environment where my students can be successful. The areas are perfect for my students but sometimes they are easily distracted by what their peers are doing in other areas. We have a few room dividers that we move from area to area and they work very well. Unfortunately I am currently using two of them as walls in our sensory area and they can not be moved. Two more room dividers to use in our work areas will keep my students focused. With these dividers I will be sure to have their undivided attention! \n\nMy students face challenges every day communicating and learning. I know that these dividers will provide a structured learning environment where they can focus on learning.

This might be a bit scary & frustrating, but at least the vacation only lasts a short time.  Now think about being dumped in a country to live where you don't know the language!  This magnifies the fear & exasperation 100 times!! \n\nI am the high school librarian at a mammoth school in California and I have partnered with the ESL teacher to expose her students to conversation skill building.  They are new to our country and just learning English.  Every other week, we host a conversation period where peers who are fluent English speakers sit with a small group of her ESL students and facilitate a conversation about anything.  It is our hope that this experience will help the ESL students practice their English and conversation skills, learn about American culture, and feel more comfortable living in our country. \n\nRight now the conversations tend to be a bit lackluster and forced, and some of the students dread coming to the library to participate in these talks.  So I would like to add some zest to the experience.  It is my hope that introducing engaging games and stimulating discussion starters will inspire so much excitement, purpose, and meaning that the ESL students will WANT to talk in order to communicate their opinions or win a game. \n\nI hope you are as committed as I am to welcoming new youngsters to our country and helping them assimilate with compassion and engagement!  The more students talk, the easier it will be for them and the more fluent they will become.  Furthermore, talking will help the students access their ideas, feelings, creativity, and beliefs which is an essential skill for every human being to master.  Therefore, I am requesting help in purchasing several language games, mad libs, and conversation starters. "

Yes, dictionaries are all over the Internet, but what if a classroom only has one computer?  Dictionaries will be the easiest reference tool that a student can have while trying to learn.  \n\nMy students are amazing!  They live in a suburb of Sacramento, California.  The school that attend is rich in diversity - more than 20 languages spoken!  And they not only surprise me everyday of what they are capable of, but they also constantly teach me how to be a better teacher and person.  My students make me laugh at what they say, smile at their growth in learning, and cry when they fight through the challenges of being young.  They are amazing.   \n\nThe classroom is an amazing place to think, learn and do.  However, there are always times when a student is trying to think, or trying to learn, but an unfamiliar word prevents them from trying to ""do"".  Instead of being independent learners, they have to stop and ask or blindly move on.  If these kids are going to be our future, they need to learn how to ""look it up"" and figure it out on their own. Having dictionaries under each desk will act as that easy reference, that quick tool, to help them move on in the learning process.  Sure, dictionaries exist for free on the Internet; but when you have only one computer in a classroom, an online dictionary is impossible.  If each student had a dictionary that is right there, he or she can use it to break through a language barrier that always exists for young, learning persons.   \n\nThis project is so important because we need to help our kids.  In a nation of economic problems, budget cuts, furloughs and increased class sizes, it is our kids who suffer.  Many of the classes in our area are at 36, 38, 40, 42 students...  that is too much.  So, by helping to buy a few dictionaries, you will be providing a little help to these kids who face so many obstacles to succeed.  By helping, you will help them help themselves when they need it.  So please, help them ""look it up"". "

A majority of the students in my classroom are at or above grade level, especially in the area of Language Arts as their parents and previous teachers have done an excellent job in preparing them for fifth grade. Therefore it is my goal to constantly challenge them to strive for greatness, instead of settling for goodness with exciting activities and projects that benefit the students in two ways. It involves them in their own learning, research has proved that students learn best this way, and it makes school an enjoyable place to visit seven hours out of the day!\n\nThis past year, a great deal of time was spent on creating and performing talk shows and interview sessions as an alternative assessment at the end of novels and, at times, social studies units. I was extremely impressed at how much students were able to connect with the material presented and ultimately understand concepts taught when they were asked to do these types of dramatic projects. Students were able to connect with the emotions and feelings of the characters from the novels we were reading through the use of talk shows that ""asked the tough questions!"" Interview sessions where students dressed up as former Presidents Roosevelt, Truman, and Wilson to answer questions were so informative to me as a teacher. This is because it gave me the opportunity to see how much they had learned during our social studies units without having to give the students the dreaded ""end of the unit test."" \n\nAlthough we were able to use the media center's equipment, and my own personal equipment at times, for some of our dramatic projects, it would be incredibly beneficial to be able to record these projects with our own classroom camcorder.  To share the information with others in DVD format would also be great as it could be shown on the morning news at our school or the projects could be shared with other fifth grade classrooms as an instructional tool for other teachers. I could also use the DVD recordings for future classes of my own as they learn new material. Possibly the most beneficial use of having a DVD recording is to allow students and parents to view the finished product. After all of the hard work they put into these projects, it is amazing to see their faces light up when they see themselves on television.\n\nWe are hoping that with your donation of a DVD camcorder we can share our projects with others and also reflect on what we have learned.

This will help students learn fundamental writing skills necessary to be more independent writers. The Handwriting Helper Kit helps students learn which way to hold the paper and which hand goes on the paper. These materials enforce proper writing direction from left to right. The Go Left to Right cards are for directional cues and the Squishy Hand Prints are for non dominant hand placement. Space Worms immediately and accurately help to space words during writing tasks. The specialized writing paper provides a space for drawing, story content as well as a bottom line that is highlighted to encourage proper placement of letters. Raised Color Cue Paper provides visual cues and raised, colored lines for children who need a more tactile, proprioceptive writing experience. The Writing C.L.A.W and Grotto Grip are specialized pencil grips that ensure proper finger position. \n\n \n\nSpecial education students are different from other students, in that they learn things in a non-traditional way. Multi-Sensory approaches teach skills through using auditory (hearing), visual (sight) and kinesthetic (movement/touch) pathways. This gives multiple pathways for the information to reach the brain.

My students struggle with not only finding the right piece, but they also lack the problem solving skills to turn the piece around to make it fit. \n\nI teach a self contained class for students with severe Autism in the inner city.  They come from low income families.  Most of my kids come from single parent homes where the parent(s) is usually unemployed.  Many of my families don't fully understand what it means that their child has Autism, let alone know how to help their child be successful.  The school that they attend is a K-8 public Montessori school.  The goal for my students is that they will do inclusion in the general education setting once they have the basic skills they need to be in a general education room (ie: be able to sit at a table).    \n\nThe materials I am requesting are all puzzles.  By completing these puzzles, my students will gain the skills they need to be more successful.  These puzzles will not only help us work on things like tending to a task for a period of time, but they will also help my students gain the knowledge over time of how to put a puzzle together.  My students will also gain problem solving skills.  Too often, my students rely 100% on adult assistance to complete a task.  These puzzles will help my students gain problem solving skills that will carry over into everyday life.  They will learn that if the piece doesn't fit, they can turn the piece and it just might fit.  With problem solving skills, my students will be less likely to have a complete meltdown because they can't figure something out.  \n\nMy students come from a very rough area.  This is not a reason why they shouldn't have the things they need to be successful and gain the skills they need to function.  I spend much of my own money on my room, but sometimes my wallet falls short.  That is where my need for YOU comes in.  Your donation will help my students gain the skills they need in their lives to someday become independent, successful adults. "

I want to provide an opportunity to teach them that they have both the talent and creativity to make interesting art. I want them to be motivated to be lifelong learners. I work at a school filled with dedicated, hard-working teachers. We want to provide all that we can for our students. \n\nThe tools provided by this grant will allow my students to experience scratch art for the first time.  This genre of art provides a tactile drawing experience for my students.  It's all about drawing with negative space.  Most of my students are used to filling a white page with black lines as they draw.  The process of scratch art, is the reverse.  You are given a page covered in black paint; the scratch tools allow you to create your image in white, as you scratch away the paint.  Mistakes cannot be undone.  Once an area is scratched away it is permanently white.  Students learn to handle ""happy accidents.""  They learn to use their creativity to turn mistakes into something really great, a skill so valuable in life. \n\nThis project is so important because it provides an opportunity for my students to work on their problem-solving skills as they are introduced to a new art genre and skill.  This project would not be possible without assistance from Donors Choose.\n\nMy supply budget for the year is less than $200 for over 200 students.

The mobile storage cart will be a fantastic way for my students to really see what costumes and props we have available to them during pretend play. The hooks will make it easy for them to clean-up after they have finished, leaving the costumes ready for the next actor to choose their role. \n\nAfter teaching another grade level for many years, this will is my first year teaching kindergarten.

Iceland volcano, Haiti earthquake). Inflatable globes allow us to write on them with wet erase markers and deflate them for easy storage (something I have very little space for).

It is designed to provide opportunities for 6th – 8th grade students to write in the major categories of the discipline and to generate a product of high personal interest to promote reading across all grades.\n\nThis year our goal is to improve the quality of the school newsletter, publish in electronic format, expand readership, and to lay the foundation to gain the support of our community businesses to promote financial assistance to sustain future publication.  Available funding does not provide us with adequate money to purchase tools necessary to achieve this goal.\n\nThe long-term goal is to develop a curriculum that will replicate the methods of news reporting from beginning to end and to create simulations of the various media such as newspapers, radio and television broadcasts, personal computer video streams, and podcasts. The proposed expansion will encompass the areas of advertising, marketing, and broadcasting.\n\nCurrently our students have Internet and telephone access (next year two lines), desktop PCs with MS Word and a black and white printer. Hence, their product is limited with respect to color, column size and design.  Further, they are not able to communicate with sources via fax, nor can they receive messages  (Essential for when no one is in the classroom). \n\nThe donation will enable our students to publish a quality product produced in a manner that more closely mirrors industry standards and most importantly will benefit our students with a rich experience in this practice.\n\nWe sincerely hope that you will grant this request to help our students improve their communication skills, which directly improves their reading and writing ability. It will advance the integration of technology into the curriculum and provide participants with an authentic, enriched, hands-on program that augments their skills in the areas of computer technology, media literacy, as well as creative writing, design, and digital photography.\n\nREMEMBER:  THE ENTIRE SCHOOL BENEFITS BECAUSE THIS ENCOURAGES ALL OF THE STUDENTS TO READ!"

Upon a beginning assessment, most of my students do not have a solid understanding of fractions, and I'm afraid that my students' house of fraction knowledge will come tumbling down. \n\nMy students are energetic, eager students that don't have access to all of the learning tools that they need to help them succeed.  On the first day of school, I asked all of my students to tell me if they like math, why, and to specifically identify which parts of math this applies to.  Most of them told me that they do not like math because it is confusing, especially fraction, and they get frustrated because they do not understand it.  \n\nMy beginning assessment showed me that many of my students struggled with simplifying, adding, and subtracting fractions.  Unfortunately our curriculum does not provide much room to re-teach or review these, instead we are moving ahead with multiplying fractions. \n\nThough many of my students have struggled, they have always been excited to be in class, have tried their hardest, and haven't given up easily.  No one has given up, even when they are frustrated, and that inspires me to work even harder to guide them towards success.   \n\nIn order to help my students succeed, I am requesting manipulatives that can help the students visualize the concepts that we are learning (in addition to helping them build their foundational skills).  Fraction cubes and fraction scales will help the students visualize equivalencies, add, and subtract because they can manipulate what they see.  This will help supplement the instruction that is given and bring it to life.\n\nOur school doesn't have the funding to buy many of these supplies, as the state budget cuts have forced administrators to make cuts in the classroom.  Additionally, the number of students that receive free or reduced lunch is high, and without a strong PTA, finding outside sources to fund this is difficult. \n\nMy goal is to take this hesitation off of them by finding new approaches to showing them that math is easier than they've told themselves.  I want my student to enjoy math and find more success than they've had before, boosting their confidence in their academic abilities and overall.\n "

Thank you! \n\nAttaining this document reader is so important because currently we only have one per 3-4 teachers. This means that we are forced to create a way to ""share"" this essential tool.

The young boys and girls who participate in the contest deserve to be recognized, and I would love it if they each could receive a beautiful ribbon and framed certificate. With your donation, each finalist (60 students) will get just that, and a wonderful tradition will be kept alive!  Also please consider the proposal ""Trophies for Women's History Contest"" to further support our top finishers.\n\nThe contest is an excellent event because students across the entire school (which is in 4 buildings and runs from Pre-school through 8th grade) learn about the achievements of women. They do research and practice reading, memorization, and most importantly, public speaking. Public speaking is hard at any age, but the more one does it, the easier it becomes. This contest is designed to help our students develop this difficult skill early on. Furthermore, as a society we spend so much time listening to and learning the words of important men, but we often forget to focus on the words of the many important women who have shaped our world. \n\nThrough your donation, the ribbons and framed certificates that are awarded to finalists will send an important message. Students will know that their hard work is valued, that they did a great service in sharing the important words of a noteworthy woman, and that they truly excelled. I'm sure many of you still have some of the trophies, certificates, and ribbons that you won in your youth and fondly remember your achievements.  \n\nHelp some DC students feel the same pride that you felt as you received those awards, and know that you'll be helping create a memory for students that will last a lifetime."

They are like sweet little sponges soaking up everything they can learn!  They are made up from a diverse set of backgrounds and include English language learners, special education students, which are all receiving free lunches.

Our meeting area is a very integral part of our day, and I want my students to enjoy that time with less distractions of seating arrangements with the comfort of sitting on the floor.  This carpet would truly change the ""meeting area"" dynamic of the room. \n\nThe students start with a morning meeting where we discuss the calendar, upcoming events, and get motivated to tackle the current day!  Currently we are sitting on a hard floor and the students get very wiggly.  I know that during our read aloud, they will enjoy sitting ""criss cross applesauce"" while listening to stories on a nice carpet.  I also lead whole group lessons at this ""meeting area"" spot during the day.  The students listen and are more engaged when they are sitting up close at a more informal spot rather than at their desks.   I will have an easel sitting at the head of the carpet so it will be a perfect spot for learning! Students participate in Daily 5, so they take responsibility for their independent reading time.  This carpet will be a great place for students to read independently throughout the day. \n\nThis carpet will make a WORLD of difference in our classroom. They students will be more willing to listen and focus during read aloud, whole group lessons, and independent reading time.  This jungle theme is perfect for my rodeo classroom.  We love animals!

My students may not get what they deserve in their own homes, but it is my hope that I can give them a place that they look forward to coming to each day. "

The keys are slow and leaky, and the poor thing needs adjustments every day. It has made frequent trips to the repair shop which is getting very costly. \n\nOur band students LOVE music. They actively participate in creating beautiful melodies, triumphant fanfares, and enchanting tunes with their instruments each and every day! For many of these students, being a part of this class is the best part of their day. They look forward to being here to rehearse, to improve their musicality, and to perform for our school and local community. \n\nWhen I started teaching at this school 7 years ago, there were 100 students signed up for band and only 20 working instruments available. As a new teacher, I knew that I would face obstacles, but not one of this magnitude. Simply put, you can't run a band program without instruments. We are in a much better situation now, but over the years, the old instruments have gotten older and now need replacing. Our band program has also gradually gotten bigger...this just means we need more instruments! So the challenge now is to continue increasing our inventory and replacing the worn instruments at the same time.\n\nWhy are we specifically asking for a Bass Clarinet? We have been trying to get more low woodwinds into our band program because we own so few. There is a lot of interest, but we don't have the instruments to lend to our students. This would be a great addition to our program because it will work to balance our ensemble sound. \n\nThis project is important because it will allow us to provide another instrument for our kids. We are taking it one piece at a time because that is all we can do. We are always going to be in a state of needing new instruments, but with each piece, we can make a difference for our students. It is a necessity that we can't ignore. Students must have instruments in order to participate in the band! "

I have been wanting a good way to let them hear how they sound, and to compare where they started to where they have gotten on the path of changing their speech.

While I encourage children to take home books from our classroom each night, and while my readers have made great strides in reading, the fact remains that in low-income communities, children often drop in reading level over the two and a half months they have summer vacation. This is primarily due to lack of access to high-interest children's literature.

It is my hope that these books will stem the tide of lower reading levels as they begin their fourth grade years. I also hope that these children, by reading over the summer, will continue to be inculcated with the idea of lifelong reading that doesn't just have to occur during the school year. \n\nPutting books into the hands of children is one of the simplest and meaningful things we can do for children, especially for those in low-income communities.

Many of the students come from families with low socio-economic status.  These students need access to a variety of texts in the classroom.  In third grade, students are expected to be able to read and comprehend a variety of nonfiction texts.  My students love to read and can successfully do this with the help of exciting nonfiction texts. \n\nMy students absolutely love nonfiction books by Steve Jenkins.  He writes and illustrates books about animals in such a way that captivates students.  Also, I have found that students are retaining the information they are learning from his books because they have read his books repeatedly.   \n\nThis project is so important because as my students grow older and even as they turn into adults, they will be expected to read and comprehend nonfiction texts throughout their lives.

If children are interested in the ideas and information that a text is providing, their possibilities of higher level learning are endless. \n\nMy students are from an area in Missouri that has seen a dramatic hit in the education department.  I believe I have the best class in my entire town because their love of learning makes my job much more exciting and even easier.  Their desire for learning is heartwarming and truly allows me to spend more time coming up with creative ideas and unique ways to educate, instead of constant discipline and behavior issues.  I know that I'm the luckiest teacher in our district by far. \n\nOur current textbooks are old and not appealing to my students. We share these text books and the pictures are so dated that my students constantly ask me about the era of when these pictures were taken because of the different styles of clothing and hairstyles. There are major events in our history that aren't printed in our text, due to the fact that these books were printed so long ago. I'm forced to search online for additional information so that my students won't be cheated of the learning that they deserve. \n\nMy project is important because all children can learn. These resources will enhance their understanding and enthusiasm in our nation's history and build a higher level of learning in geography. History of our nation is extremely important for children to learn so they can better understand why we have freedom and where it came from. Learning about our history will develop the background knowledge to understand what people in the past have experienced, so that we are safe and free. "

The school is only in its 11th year but they have a 100% graduation and college acceptance rate for all seniors. This is an excellent school academically but its PE department is far from excellent. Our students have to run a mile a week but instead of using pedometers to accurately measure how far they run they are forced to yell our what lap they are on. This leads to me as the teacher being frustrated because I can't keep an accurate count of how far they are going. My kids want to excel at Physical Education and be healthy but they just don't have the resources. As a Physical Education teacher I feel my students deserve the same luxuries as other more affluent schools. With pedometers my kids would be take ownership over the obesity epidemic that is sweeping the country. \n\nThe resources will change our students lives because the physical activity they receive in Physical Education is probably the only they receive during the course of a day. They aren't privileged with the ability to go to fancy health clubs to work out.

Our students deserve the same opportunities as our students their age and at our school these pedometers would really make a difference. "

Imagine going through your day not being able to truly express your needs, wants, and ideas.  This is how many of my students have spent their entire lives.  I work with several students with severe communication deficits and motor skills impairments.  \n\nThe field of Special Education has made great advances in developing ways to support students with difficulty speaking and signing.  One such advance is the use of picture communication systems.  By seeing, pointing to, and exchanging picture and symbol cards, students can express themselves and better understand what others are saying to them.  In order to effectively implement such a system, the teacher must have access to a program such as Boardmaker. This program is computer based and uses a graphic database. \n\nBoardmaker generates the pictures and symbols that make up the communication system.  I have observed and spoken with teachers who use similar systems in their classrooms; and they, as well as research on best teaching practices, say that this is an integral part in supporting children with communication deficits for success.  My students are full of thoughts and ideas to share with their teachers, classmates, and families.  I know that having Boardmaker will help me to support them as they try to communicate and better understand those around them.  "

Our school is the largest elementary school in our county, with over 1,400 students. \n\nThe majority of my students are English Language Learners (ELL.) I have students who speak Portuguese, Spanish, and Creole. I also have two students with Speech concerns. My students are hard working, enjoy learning, and are extremely motivated to gain knowledge. Although these students have more of a battle to be on grade level because they are also learning English, they are meeting grade level criteria. These children are fighting the odds and proving themselves.\n\nTheir efforts have not gone unnoticed. This year my students entered a poster contest about the streets in our community, and four of them were presented first prize ribbons at City Hall by the mayor of our city. The students worked in a cooperative group to create a winning and final product. \n\nWhen it comes to resources at our school, we have many of the things we need and do the best with what we don't have. One thing that we do not have enough of is: computers that meet the needs of our students. Sadly, most of the computers we do have are extremely out of date and can not run many of the educational programs and websites available to our students. I currently have two computers in my class, with 18 students. \n\nComputers are a huge expense. So what can be done? Tablets are less expensive and a great tool to access many websites and educational apps. For example, Scholastic has an app for books that can be used on the Ipad. I will be able to download books that the students will be able to enjoy and read interactively. \n\nVisual and hands-on teaching tools are very important when teaching ELL students, and are helpful with using specific strategies to teach these students. I hope to put these two Ipads at a Literacy Center in my class. \n\nYour donations will make a big difference in my class! I won't have to have a computer waiting list, or timed schedule for students who need to access the computer. There will be more Internet access available in my classroom.

The touchscreen will be great for hands-on learners, the screen will appeal to visual learners, and the sound will appeal to auditory learners. Education in the palm of our hands... "

","With the incredible advancements in educational programs on the Internet, it is a shame that many of my students do not have the chance to experience or benefit from it. Access to technology opens a world that could very well make the difference in their education and their lives. \n\nMy kindergarten students are eager to learn, explore and grow. However, because of their lack of resources, about half of my students cannot afford a computer. They attend a dual immersion elementary school in California, playing and learning alongside students who touch technology every day at home. Many of my low-income students are working below grade level and would definitely benefit from online programs like Reading Eggs and Math Magician that make learning fun and interactive. Most of these students are in the school's free and reduced lunch program. Their parents work two jobs and have not had access to higher education. They cannot help their children by closing the technology gap. \n\nThese laptops will change my students' lives by giving them access to the Internet and hands-on experience with technology.  No longer will they be the only kids in class who have never touched a computer! They will be able to access the online programs offered via our school website and have fun practicing phonics, reading and math. Plus, I will be able to quickly communicate with their parents via email, sharing information that makes our class run more smoothly and benefits all of my students. \n\nOne of the goals of our school is to try to close the achievement gap that exists between our more affluent students and those at an economic disadvantage. In my classroom, I have students who struggle with basic concepts like the alphabet, phonics and counting. I give them all the help and resources we can offer at school, but it is not enough. They lack the technology at home that could make the difference in their education and their lives. Take-home laptops will help us close the gap. "

We have limited access to computers in our building, so using the one computer in our classroom to model information is the best way for us to embed technology in our curriculum.\n \n\nIn a classroom of students who are all at different academic levels, it can be challenging to keep all learners engaged and on task. Being able to access the projector and video clips at all times of the school day, I will be able to capture and maintain their attention and allow them to make connections to the curriculum. Providing a visual representation of the concepts will further enhance learning. Teaching these 21st century skills is essential in today’s classroom.  "

My students often struggle with reading comprehension so they are always being encouraged to read and then tell about the book and if possible, take an Accelerated Reader comprehension test.

That's the challenge many of my elementary students face on a daily basis at school - a challenge that is hindering the learning of many students. \n\nMy students are 2nd graders in a highly Latino urban neighborhood in California. Most of my students enter Kindergarten knowing little or no English and are expected to achieve at the same levels as their English speaking peers. Because of this my school has developed a bilingual program, wherein students and their families opt into classrooms that, beginning in Kindergarten, teach primarily in Spanish (and gradually introduce English). This program, paired with the high quality lessons teachers prepare, not only helps our students develop strong Spanish language skills, but it also helps students access other important skills and content without a language barrier. Furthermore, when students have developed strong Spanish language skills they are then able to transfer their understanding of language to help them learn English more successfully. \n\nI am requesting close to 50 children's books in Spanish at all different levels for my students to use during independent reading time. The bilingual program at my school is expanding slowly and currently we do not have enough books in Spanish for each child to read during our reading workshop. I aim to supplement our current library so that students will have access to around 5 books to read at their level each week. This will not only promote reading growth, but the variety of titles will also enhance engagement and interest in learning to read. \n\nThe bilingual model my school has implemented will surely enhance not only the Spanish language skills of my students but also the English language skills. Already, 1st and 2nd grade students who entered school knowing little English are able to read, write and perform other subjects at grade level in BOTH languages. Having access to high quality literature in Spanish will strengthen our efforts to help these youngsters become proficient bilingual speakers, readers, writers and mathematicians. "

However, they need to work on their writing.  \n\nMost interesting, I have found that, before finishing a thought, my students often wish to know how to spell advanced words and their first instinct is to ask for my assistance.  Most of the time I remind these eager first graders to use the ""sound-it-out"" technique to write down the word. This helps some of the time. The majority of the times my students are stopped mid thought. \n\nBy providing each of my students a picture dictionary, it would keep their thoughts flowing and improve their writing tremendously.\n\nWith a dictionary available at each student's desk, I can start teaching them how to look up a word in the dictionary.  Then, they can use it, at least, for their in-class writing or reading assignments. \n\nGradually, they will become independent and life-long learners.  One of the big goals for my first grade students is that they can write a paragraph with at least ten good sentences.  Since this is the first time for them to write a paragraph, they have to learn about proper sentence and paragraph structure.  \n\nIn addition to that, they also have to learn correct spellings, a little bit about parts of speech such as verbs, nouns, and adjectives.  Therefore, a dictionary at hand would be a great advantage for them to explore a word's meanings, parts of speech, and especially to check their spelling.  This would make them feel more confident in learning.  \n\nMore than just a resource for a one-time project, these picture dictionaries will help my students for all their reading and writing assignments throughout the school year.  They will become life-long learners, good spellers, readers and writers, and they can use this learning skill as they go on to upper grade levels.\n\nI hope you consider supporting this need for my future first grade students.  Thank you in advance for your generosity.\n"

With so much to do and so little time, my students need a listening center that is easy to access, handle, and operate independently. \n\nWith a listening center full of books and matching CDs, my students will have yet another way to access the magic of books.  Hearing the voice of a storyteller as they follow along in their book, will not only entertain them and keep them engaged, but it will aid in their journey towards becoming fluent readers. "

This kit will provide all materials needed.,"You can grow your own protein and vegetables! That's right; my students realize how important food production is, considering our population growth! Students will manage a system that will allow them to produce a protein (fish) and use the fish waste to support plant growth hydroponically.  \n\nThese students come from a very small community and are part of the school's agriculture program. The class size of the school is small as they usually graduate about 30 students per year. The atmosphere at school is good- promoting hands-on learning without sacrificing the student's ability to relate what is happening in the classroom with the hands-on activities. Unfortunately, with the budget the school has to maintain, there are not excess funds for projects like this aquaculture system. As a new teacher, I am trying to incorporate new, exciting experiences into their learning that is rigorous and relevant to the school atmosphere.\n\nWith these materials the students will get hands-on experience of what aquaculture is! This project can inspire and help students in many ways. The course curriculum will include information on careers related to aquaculture. Teaching aquaculture in the classroom is one thing, but EXPERIENCING a system like this is another. Students will construct the system upon arrival. Students will be in charge of monitoring the system. Students will monitor fish growth and determine what plants to grow. This program will not only benefit the classroom students, but will also benefit the FFA program as well. The National FFA Organization (previously Future Farmers of America) provides students with leadership development through agriculture education. This system will provide a student with a supervised agriculture experience (sae) to further the classroom instruction by taking this leadership role.  \n\nDo you want to eat in the future? It is predicted that by the year 2050 our population will be 9 billion people. With farm land decreasing, there could be a problem with feeding a population of this size in our current system. This aquaculture system provides an experience for students to see an alternative agriculture system in action! These students will be the scientists and citizens solving this food problem in the year 2050, let's provide them with the tools necessary to get the job done! "

Unfortunately, my Second Graders spend too much time waiting for jump-ropes and balls, rather than actually enjoying their break time.  Please, help us out!!! \n\nI currently teach Second Grade in a public school located in an urban area in the Southwest.  My students enjoy playing Freeze Tag, Dodgeball, and Tetherball.  It is my hope that I will receive balls, a ball pump, and jump ropes for my students to use during PE and recess.  Recently, I tried to teach them a variation of dodgeball called Space Invaders, but we needed four playground balls.  Locating the equipment was a hassle.  With this grant I will have the equipment in my own classroom.  The ball pump would be an added perk.  Thank you for supporting this request so we can have lots of Fitness Fun in the Sun. \n\nWith this grant, my students will enjoy their Physical Education time like never before.  We'll have jump rope contests, four square tournaments, and basketball relay games.  Every day, they'll beg to finish their work, so we can get outside for PE.  At present, I have one Frisbee and a jump rope in my classroom for 20 students.  Neither one was provided by the school.  Having the equipment outlined in this project will allow my students to enjoy their freetime and PE, which will lead to classroom success.  Relaxed, renewed, and refreshed, the kids will enjoy their breaks and return to class ready to learn and concentrate on their academics again. \n\nFitness Fun in the Sun is a very worthy project.  My little darlings won't need to spend their PE or recess time waiting for equipment anymore.  Don't you want to be part of the solution to this problem?

Most of them are minority students and technology is very limited in the school.  I want to open the eyes of some of my students to the opportunities of other technology, specifically MacIntosh.  Over the summer I transferred from a school which was well equipped with computers, even a Mac lab.  My class used the lab six or seven times a year to produce projects using the iLife software.  Usually these projects involved writing a script depicting an event in history, acting out the event , recording it on a digital video camera, and using iLife to edit the production.  This process proved to be entertaining and educational on many levels.  I have even showed student projects year after year to new students to introduce topics.  \n\nI am hoping to continue this successful strategy by purchasing a Mac.  It will be used in my Spanish classroom for teaching vocabulary, documenting student skits or poetry, dubbing new dialog over previously made video, and anything else my or my students' imaginations can create.  I will have 6 classes of 25 students, I hope to give all of them the opportunity to experience this resource.  Outside of language learning, the students will benefit from working with this technology.  It will be a great addition to the school which currently has no MacIntosh technology."

I want to help develop a love of reading in students who cannot wait to discover how far their imagination and a book will take them. \n\nI am asking for additional books at levels J, K, L and N.  Donations to this project will provide my students with books that will create a greater range of reading levels. They will have the ability to select, read and enjoy books at their own level without the stigma of choosing from books that are beyond their reading levels. As their reading levels increase, as an added bonus, they will have books available in the library.  "

Or when a teacher read a book and you couldn't see the pages?  With the magic of the document camera, it makes it possible for all students to see everything you are teaching. \n\nMy students are very hands on visual learners.  They need to be able to see everything with examples or with the exact worksheet they are using.  They would highly benefit from a document camera in the classroom by allowing them to see the worksheet enlarged on the board, manipulate objects for all to see and explain why they are doing it their way, and see a small text such as a book enlarged on the Smartboard. \n\nI will use the document camera in many different ways.\n*Zoom in on small details of a story or text\n*Demonstrate correct paragraph structure and writing techniques for 6+1 writing strategies\n*Photos and images can be communicated to a large group\n*Display student work to do peer editing and show correct examples such as with a test\n*Complete graphic organizers as a whole group\n*complete worksheets together as a group.  This leads to less confusion as to what and where to write especially with low students and ESL\n*Model how to do an activity correctly by using their exact paper\n*Using letter/word tiles to arrange them to form sentences and spelling words\n*Display books that are not available in class sets\n*Display a picture for a writing prompt\n*Teach dictionary skills by placing dictionary under camera\n*Teach a phonics lesson where I can highlight parts of speech in a real text\n*Teach context clues by showing the words around the unfamiliar word \n\nOur district spends all of its technology money on the high schools.  That leaves the elementary schools to purchase things on their own or to utilize what they have in their classrooms. I have written a grant in the past to get a smartboard and this document camera would allow me to use the smartboard to its full potential. Our students come from a high poverty area and this would help them to meet their educational needs and provide them with experiences needed to be successful. "

I have a program called P.A.L. {Parents Active in Learning} that I am trying to use to involve parents in this process. In this program, the student takes a book home each week to read with a parent or other grown up. If a student does not have a willing P.A.L. at home, volunteers read with the child at school. The books are easy readers so that the child can read it back to their parent by the end of the week. I have seen this build confidence in so many children.  At this time, I do not have enough books available in my room to run this program all year.  Therefore, I am asking for sets of easy readers (80 books in all) to extend this program. This would also give those who are reading the opportunity to read several books a week. These books would make a tremendous difference in the lives of these children who sometimes do not have any books of their own to read with an adult."

Depending on where we are in the chapter, my students may take down lecture notes, converse during a group assignment, or work with textbook assignments. \n\nMy students are gifted and they attend a performing arts/high ability high school in a poor urban area.  Our school district is suffering from severe budget cuts from the state because of low test scores throughout the city.  During my first year teaching at the school, which was last school year, my students helped our school to out perform all other high schools in our city on the state's end of course assessment test in Biology. Our scores were on par with some of the more wealthy and prestigious school districts in surrounding communities.All of the labs that I provided for my students last year were provided out of my own pocket, something I cannot afford to continue doing.  My students are enthusiastic learners, who perform better on tests when they have lab opportunities. \n\nMy students love to do labs and they learn better through hands on experiences.  My students will learn medical terminology that will help them on standardized tests, in college, and it will also help them to become knowledgeable and informed citizens.  The dissection techniques will assist those students who may aspire to careers in the medical field.  By dissecting fetal pigs, they will study gross anatomy and they will also study thin film microscopic views of the cells in various organs throughout the pigs body.  I have chosen the fetal pig for my students, because it is an animal that can be used in the high school setting, whose body systems somewhat mirror those of humans; the circulatory, digestive, respiratory, and reproductive systems, to name a few. Through the use of this dissection opportunity, they will learn more about the systems and processes of their own bodies.  This will surely be helpful to students even if they do not plan to pursue careers in medicine. \n\nEven though I am new to this school, I am a veteran teacher.  I have seen through the years the effect that lab activities can have on student interest, attendance, and learning.  I have witnessed students who were bored with school and had poor attendance, come to school everyday to participate in lab activities.  Without funding for this project, how will we ever know what my students could have done for the world in the areas of medicine or scientific research. "

Wrap-ups are wonderful tools for all students because they encompass all of the learning styles.,My students need a class set of Multiplication Wrap-ups to improve basic math facts.,"I am convinced that my school has the best children on the planet!  I teach third grade to an enthusiastic bunch of children. \n\nSome of these children have all needed resources available to them.  However, many do not.  It helps to have resources that children can use in the classroom when you know they don't get the extra attention they need at home. \n\nDo you remember all of the tireless hours spent memorizing math facts?  Did you use those boring flash cards?  Did your mom make you write the facts over and over until you felt sure your hand would fall off?  Imagine how much fun it would be to learn these essential math facts in a fun way.\n\nLearning Wrap-ups provide that fun for students.  Each set of wrap-ups provides math facts for every number.  Students wrap a string from the problem on the left to the answer on the right.  Using a self-correcting key on the back, the students can assess their progress.  A corresponding CD, ""Wrap-up Rap"", accompanies the wrap-ups.  \n\nWrap-ups are wonderful tools for all students because they encompass all of the learning styles.  Auditory learners find the CD helpful.  Visual learners can ""see"" the problems as they solve them.  Most importantly, it is phenomenal for kinesthetic learners because they are using their hands to help them learn.\n\nStudents have so much fun with these that they are willing to use them repeatedly.  They learn their facts before they realize it. \n\nYour contribution will take the necessary task of memorizing math facts and make it an exciting adventure for all students.  As a teacher, it is difficult to teach basic facts.  I can require that they be practiced each night at home, but the help that is needed is not always available.  In reality, facts have to be memorized.  Only the students themselves can do that.  In order to be memorized, they have to be practiced.  Is there a better way to practice math facts than to use a method that is this much fun?"

They are energetic, enthusiastic and love to learn new things. For approximately 40% of the students at my school English is not their first language. Each student brings special qualities that provide opportunities to foster language development and growth.  My hope is to foster that language development through artistic expression. \n\nStART Creating! will allow my students the opportunity to intertwine art and language as modes of self-expression while developing and fine-tuning skills of observation. I was fortunate enough to receive funding for 42 artists' biographies from Donorschoose recently.  With these books and the materials I am requesting, students will learn about different art techniques and forms, and will apply that knowledge by creating original works of art themselves. \n\nThese pieces of artwork will serve as inspiration for their writing. Students will be delving into different ways to express themselves through powerful literary devices such as similes, metaphors, and personification. They will also be reinforcing reading strategies (inference, visualization, questioning, predicting) as they explore the various artistic pieces. \n\nArt transcends cultures and language.  It motivates and inspires. Your donation will help me to bring basic art supplies right into our classroom so that my students can be inspired and stART creating! "

Our school provides a nurturing environment and our curriculum is rigorous--now we just need some extra materials to nurture a love of reading. \n\nMany of my students enter kindergarten with limited literacy experiences but they must become readers by the end of the year. To accomplish this goal, we spend much of the day engaged in different kinds of reading--listening to a read aloud, reading in a small group, reading familiar poems, and reading with buddies. My students especially love to explore books at our classroom library. They browse through our book bins looking for the ""perfect"" book to curl up with--but my functional classroom currently does not provide for a cozy spot for them to read! A child-sized armchair and sofa would give my students the opportunity to experience the pleasure of settling into soft cushions and immersing themselves in a good book! \n\nYour donation will help nurture a life-long love of reading.

Each of our students has his or her own laptop, and our teachers also have Smartboards, document cameras, DVD players, eInstruction machines and video cameras. \n\nWhat we are missing is easy access to digital music. Downloading music on school computers is risky business, and one that our district is hesitant to allow us to do. There are so many amazing lessons that can be tied to music,and we want to be able to incorporate all types of music into our lessons. We are all avid fans of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the lessons that are created at their celebrated Summer Teacher's Institute, and now we are looking to find new musical connections with our students. The iPods will make this happen for us. \n\nTo be able to easily and effectively reach our students with music, each of our English teachers needs an iPod shuffle. \n\nThe iPods will allow us to save, transport and present music to our students in a safe and legal manner. Our students will be able to incorporate music into their Movie Maker and Photo Story projects, and with Audacity, we will be able to teach them about copyright laws and issues as well. We will teach them to be responsible digital music owners that can punch up a presentation and wow their future employers! \n\nYour generous donation will ensure that our teachers can fill our classes with the sound of music and connect to our students on a deeply profound level.

Our school is located in a rural, high poverty area of Mississippi. Most students receive free or reduced lunch, and our school is currently under conservatorship due to financial circumstances. In the past, I received money set aside for gifted education to spend on materials for my classroom. Unfortunately, I no longer receive this money. \n\nMy students need a webcam and headset so they may participate in video conferences and create podcasts. Videoconferencing with experts, participating in virtual field trips, collaborating with students across the globe, making new and exciting learning opportunities easily accessible, being able to show and share knowledge gained in a way that is truly engaging and fun..... the possibilities are endless! School can be so boring today. Having these resources will bring new life to our educational environment and make learning meaningful, interesting, and enjoyable once again. Students will not only be advancing their technological abilities, they will be gaining and sharing knowledge on various topics in various ways. For a specific example, COSI in Ohio shows a live knee-replacement surgery over video conference. Cost of the program not only covers the video-conference, it includes a kit with build-a-knee, x-ray examination, suturing, knee measuring, and sterile field activities. This technology will give my students access to places and activities they could only dream about before. \n\nWith all the focus on standardized testing today and raising those basic and minimal scores, gifted students are often given the back burner.

The iPad will help differentiate instruction and allow my students to grow as they take a proactive approach to learning. \n\nThis project is such an important one as we progress into the future.  Technology is a becoming a vital part of the classroom.  As my diverse group of students move forward with their education, they will learn to use technology to its fullest potential, but only if the technology is available.   Technology will engage them in their own education, and they will become active participants working toward their future! "

In our classroom, we try to create a comfortable, secure environment where children can relax and play so that in turn they will be ready to learn! \n\nOur special education class consists of students K-5, ages 5-11, who are impacted by moderate to severe disabilities, including intellectual disability as well as mobility and physical limitations. Several of our students are in wheelchairs and demonstrate discomfort with the positions that they are limited to for the majority of their time. Others need adult assistance for walking, sitting upright and/or use of hands and fingers. Our students receive physical and occupational therapy as well as adapted PE to meet their physical needs. \nWe also try to incorporate fun, relaxing movement into our daily schedule, to give our students opportunities to enjoy themselves and each other as non-disabled peers are able to do. Currently, we have a dance break every day, and several movement periods where students in chairs can get on the floor to stretch and play. However, we find our play materials are more than lacking, and bordering on unsafe due to age and usage. This is why we need your help. \n\nWith new gym mats and a rug, our floors will be safe, clean and accessible to all of our students when they are able to take breaks from their chairs. With comfortable chairs and beanbag furniture, students who aren't able to hold themselves upright will be able to be comfortably positioned while participating in activities like circle time and dance break--their peers will be able to play and dance with THEM, and not with their wheelchairs. This will make a tremendous difference for these children. Finally, with a nice storage shed we will have a place to keep these wonderful items safe and clean so that students can continue to use them for a long time to come. \n\nBy donating to support this project you will be helping students who are already at a disadvantage when it comes to having a typical child's experience. You will bring them that much closer to a full enjoyment of their peers, their school environments and themselves! Our hope is that our students will be provided with the safety and comfort that all people deserve and that some have to work so hard for. Once that need is cared for, the students will be able to focus on learning all they can. "

Consequently, we do not receive much money from the federal government.  Teachers are purchasing electronic tablets and laptops with their own money for their students to use in the classroom. \n\nAs I stated before, Greenwood is not a Title I school.  Therefore, according to NCLB, any other low-achieving school can choose to send their students to us, but we receive no additional federal funding.  Our students are a true picture of the American ""melting pot"".  We have some students who come from a very affluent background.  We also have a high population of students from other countries around the world, as well as many students from a very low socioeconomic background.  Therefore, it is impossible to ask that parents provide technology for their students. \n\nThe use of technology in an elementary classroom is crucial. 21st century learners are always motivated to use technology. I have used my personal iPad in the classroom connected to a projector to teach whole group lessons in Science and Social Studies.  We use fun apps to challenge ourselves in math.  I use it to give background knowledge to our English Language Learners. It would be incredible if I could ultimately get enough iPads in my classroom so that groups of students could use them on a rotational basis! \n\nI believe that if my students had access to more technology in the classroom, they would excel in all academic subjects!  They would be excited about learning on their own.  They could teach each other about their discoveries.  Your donations would make a huge difference in the academic lives of my students! "

Yet on my campus simply obtaining access to computer for students' use is difficult. The on-line activities that are available would be such an asset to their understanding abstract science concepts if we only had computers. \n\nMy students attend a small rural school.  The  population consists mainly of minorities and students  from low socio-economic families. The community they live in is a struggling small time with lots of civic pride but little resources.  \n\nSeveral young people in our community take great pleasure is doing their best in all the normal extra curricular activities any other student body would participate in.  We have award winning athletes, artists and academic scholars. But the number of those who excel are not as high as we want.  Too many of our students feel frustrated and left behind.  Yet, you can see their desire to achieve and succeed.  \n\nThese young people are very limited in their exposure to other places besides their little community and the surrounding area. I have seniors who were asking for a field trip to an aquarium because they had never seen one.  The only real fish they have ever seen are catfish or fish-sticks.  They long to know a reality other than the sit-com syndrome.  \n\nSo many times we are frustrated when we cannot do some of the projects we want to do or can't go places we want to go. Our mascot is the tiger and I want to use net-books to capture these guys and keep them in school. \n\nThe net-books I want to bring into the classroom would allow students to take virtual field-trips, transcribe DNA, control cell division during mitosis and even dissect a virtual frog. Not only will abstract science concepts become more concrete for them they will also be improving their technology skills. They will be able to communicate with actual scientists and lab technicians, to ask questions and hear from real people in the field. \n\nThe net-books will make their learning real and in real time.  Their information won't be coming from outdated textbooks but from up-to-date sources.  Good Internet etiquette and savvy surfing will be another plus that comes from net-books in the classroom. Knowing how to find reliable and trustworthy sites is a must for everyone.    \n\nBecause of the school's lack of facilities and materials, students and teachers have to struggle hard to achieve what we do.  School administrators do the best they can with what they have, but our students deserve better. Actually, they deserve the best. Then perhaps they would all give us their best.  \n\nAlthough I am only asking for a few net-books, and I know I need more, I am confident that this will get us started in the right direction. My motto, baby steps.  Running starts at baby steps. "

There are many broken homes my classes and emotional issues at home, and this is a great outlet for the students.  \n\nI am requesting a Cricut machine, cartridges and paper, to give my students more tools to use to express themselves. Art is also a great tool to instill concepts into the child's long term memory. When they their hands to create the concepts they have been taught it gives them a deeper understanding of what they are learning. I also teach visualization as a comprehension tool. When students begin reading chapter books with little or no pictures they need to be able to visualize what is going on the the story in their head. I teach that by having them put it on paper. These tools will just give the more tools to use in their creative learning.   \n\nThe Cricut machine will give creating that WOW factor that really grabs the students attention. They will also be incorporating technology in their art. Students love to work with their hands and this will light that fire that is sometimes needed to spark their imagination!! "

","Literacy is a life skill needed to be a successful citizen, but it is also a tool that can lead to lessons about life. I teach 8th grade Language Arts in a high poverty school. Opportunities to expose my students to diverse literature is a priority that is often hard to meet due to a lack of resources. \n\nMany of my students don't have books at home, and for some a trip to the library is often an unrealistic expectation. Funding for education is hard to come by at this time in our society anywhere, but in a high-poverty school it is even more scarce. My students lack resources outside the classroom, and it is my responsibility to find a way to provide them with the experiences that will enrich their lives. \n\nI want to do a literature unit using the novel ""The Boy in the Striped Pajamas"". This book is written from a nine year old boy's point of view whose father is a Nazi commander. It takes a naive perspective because the boy is only a young child whose parents have sheltered him from the reality that is happening right outside his bedroom window at one of the death camps. He befriends a boy on the other side of the fence, and the book takes a tragic turn. I feel that this book first lends itself to teaching my students life lessons about history, friendship, intolerance, and the Holocaust. It also lends itself perfectly to practicing two of the most critical reading skills in the 8th grade curriculum: making inferences and drawing conclusions. I look forward to exposing my students to a story that will change their minds and enhance their growth toward becoming ethical citizens who impact their own society in a hopefully positive way. I also know that this unit will challenge them to become the critical readers they need to be when they enter high school. \n\nYou have the opportunity to not only impact my students' educational lives, but also a chance to impact our larger society by molding some of our society's future leaders who will some day be making decisions that keep us from repeating some of history's mistakes."

This is difficult with them sitting in their desk. They try to sit on the small carpet square we have now, but it can not hold all of them.  \n\nMy school's population is mostly military.  Most of my students are from military families with one or more parent deployed.  They come from a variety of life experiences due to their background.  They love to be read to.  With only one parent at home the daily responsibilities are very demanding. Because of that it is difficult to fit a reading time into their routine. Not only would this carpet offer a place to sit and read together, it would also create a feeling of relaxation and security.  Individually the children will have a place to escape into a book and for a little while be transported away from their worry and fears of missing a parent.   \n\nReading is the key to education.  Children who love reading at an early age will be life long readers and learners.  This carpet will be able to create an environment for this love to grow and develop.  It will offer the children the opportunity to sit in a group where everyone can hear what is being read as well as seeing the illustrations.  It offers a quite place to sit while individually while choosing a book they would like to read for themselves rather then having to sit on the floor. \n\nReading and children's books are my passion.  I can not describe the rewards I receive from seeing how my children respond to stories read orally.  Hopefully they will pass this on to their children by reading to them.  Children learn by modeling - what better to model than the love of books.  Hopefully they will remember their reading experiences and pass them on to their children.

I have created and purchased lots of hands-on manipulatives that we use each day such as paper money, card games, and book marks. With a laminator I will be able to preserve these precious tools to be used year after year. I will also be able to save posters, vocabulary words, and even maps. These items liven up the classroom and reinforce lessons. Another thing that I will laminate is great student work. Students can keep some of these accomplishments as a prized possession and I can save some to show future students what is expected of them if they receive the same assignment. One last thing I need to mention is that seasonal and holiday decorations will also be laminated to keep my classroom looking festive and fun at all times! \n\nMy students and the environment will benefit from getting a laminator in my classroom. Ordinary use and exposure ruins materials that my students and I put a lot of time, effort, and money into making. A laminator will preserve these items and many more. Years from now my students will be utilizing these classroom materials if we get the laminator and extra laminating pouches that we need to protect them! "

I mainly work with 4th graders preparing them for the FCAT Writing Test.  We have high number of transient and ESOL students, who have few educational activities outside of school. Some of my students have never seen a cow, been to a museum, or played organized sports.  They know little about what is beyond the trailer they live in.  The poor economic times have reduced our tax base and we have no money for field trips.  \n\nI teach in Florida, and the majority of my students have never been to the beach, Cape Canaveral, EPCOT, Disney World, or even on a vacation.  This limits the background knowledge they enter my classroom with.  With a high number of students on free or reduced lunch, I try to teach a lot of my lessons using food.  They love being read aloud to, especially if I use an accent.  They adore: reading to Sarah Seuss, the Reading Therapy Dog; hands-on learning, using their five senses, and Writing.    \n\nResearch has shown that in order to teach vocabulary best, students need to see a picture with the vocabulary word illustrating the meaning.  Our school only has black and white printers, and color printers make a huge difference in the pictures needed for vocabulary instruction.  Also, bringing various real life experiences into the classroom via a flip camera, will enrich their vocabulary and background knowledge enabling them to pull from this knowledge and have a foundation to build upon.  The majority of my students are at a disadvantage when it comes to Reading.  Research shows that a student from poverty has heard 13 million words by the time they start school, a student from a working class family has heard 26 million words, and a student from a professional family has heard 45 million words.  A good children's book is three times richer in vocabulary than a conversation.  A printer and camera will give us tools to help increase students' Reading vocabulary and Writing skills.  \n\nSarah Seuss is a ""high interest"" teaching tool in my classroom, but real learning will take place with other tools that cost money I don't have.  The color printer, and flip video camera will allow technology to enhance my teaching and student learning.  The students can help create picture books, movies, oral presentations.  The benefit of increasing vocabulary can only improve Reading and Writing scores.  These tools would be appreciated and carefully used. "

In our fast paced society, it is very difficult to get parents to come to school during the day for a performance (it is very difficult to get most of them (or my students) to come to school in the evening, as well).\n\nThe digital video camera will allow my students to produce and publish their own learning success for everyone to see.

This would help students with visually seeing onset and rimes meeting to create words.  \n\nI could also access the Internet and we could make connections to science and technology.  When studying about different regions in the world, I could access images on the internet instead of trying to explain what it's like in Europe!  This projector would provide a whole new world of learning to my students. \n\nMy students are in first grade and need all the support they can have in learning how to read.  Help make a difference in a six year old's path to reading!  These children are already at a disadvantage in terms of resources at the school and this projector would really make a HUGE difference.

Having a TI ViewScreen will enable me to quickly go over handheld basics in the beginning, and then focus our time in class on mastering the abstract...",My students need a TI-89 viewscreen so that they can easily grasp the algebraic concepts we are mastering in class. ,"I teach some of the most amazing, hard-working, talented students - students who desire to change the world around them by starting with themselves...and a solid education. \n\nI teach 7th-grade Algebraic Thinking. Next year, I am moving up with my students to 8th grade to teach them Algebra I. \n\nAll of my students are students of color; a significant portion of them will be the first in their families to attend college. They have made a brave choice to commit to a longer school day (7AM to 5PM) and school year (two Saturdays per month and two weeks during the summer in addition to the regular school year) in order to achieve their goal of a college education and a better life.  \n\nIn addition to the literacy gap our country faces, there is a also a STEM gap. Many of our students are lacking the fundamental critical thinking skills that classes in the STEM areas provide. A huge obstacle is students visualizing the concepts taught in Algebra, especially when it comes to representing linear relationships graphically. Since Algebra is a gateway course for higher levels of math and science courses in high school (and in college), it is critical that this obstacle be addressed. \n\nIn Algebra I, our students will be using graphing calculators heavily. A huge amount of time is often lost due to having to walk around to each student to be sure they are on the same page. Also, without graphing calculators, many abstract concepts in Algebra will be either lost or not easily conveyed. \n\nHaving a TI ViewScreen will enable me to quickly go over handheld basics in the beginning, and then focus our time in class on mastering the abstract concepts in Algebra. The viewscreen projector will assist in mastering these concepts now. This will put these students in the position to enter high school with a math credit to their name and to take AP Calculus as seniors in high school, further increasing their chances of college admission.\n\nThe reality is, my students are facing these brutal facts every day: (1) students who do not take higher-level math classes are the least prepared for college - only 11% of college freshmen are African-American and only 7% are Hispanic; (2) in 2001, only 10% of Black students and 9% of Hispanic students took math classes beyond Algebra as compared to 22% of White students and 43% of Asian students; and (3) only 13% of students who completed Algebra I actually completed college as compared to 73% of those who completed Calculus as seniors in high school. Taking Algebra I now will put my students in that 73%. Your donation will help secure that...it will also help us push those numbers in the right direction."

Allowing these students to have this sort of technology in the classroom provides for a chance to learn hands on.,"My students need a digital camera, so we can take photos of students working--doing experiments and other investigations--and use them at other times to review concepts.","Working in an area of underprivileged children, teachers need to come up with exciting ways to get the students involved in active learning. Teachers who use digital cameras can get students out of the classroom and into their environment to capture real-world examples of educational concepts. \n\nWe are a fifth grade language arts class in an inner city school in New York.  We are an enthusiastic bunch of active learners who are always looking for ways to make the classroom and curriculum a little more interesting.  We come to school prepared every day and use the little resources that we have to create a fun, innovative, working environment. \n\nAllowing these students to have this sort of technology in the classroom provides for a chance to learn hands on.  Students will be involved in taking pictures, and creating projects with these images.  Students will use the images as writing prompts, and for descriptive writing.  Students will also use photos taken by the teacher to evaluate student work and review concepts at a later time. These children will be excited to use this hands on technology in the classroom and I feel it will promote creativity within each child. \n\nHaving this resource in our classroom is so important to the children as well as myself because as an educator we look for new and exciting ways everyday to get our students involved and allow them a chance to run with their creativity.  Creativity and expression take on many forms.  Having a camera, I feel they will look forward to using it to express themselves through the images they capture.  A picture is worth a thousand words! What better way to express individualism in each student! "

","Students with disabilities often struggle to express themselves, and have a hard time letting others know their thoughts and feelings.  Art breaks that barrier and allows all kids, even kids with the most significant disabilities the chance to express themselves. \n\nMy kids are in grades 2-5 and are the coolest kids you will meet.  Every kiddo in my class has a significant disability that greatly impacts all areas of their life.  Many of my students also have physical disabilities that impede their ability to access simple materials at school like pencils, crayons, or paintbrushes.  They love school and love to learn.  Art is a favorite because it has no barriers, they can all create and put something beautiful into the world. \n\nI am requesting art materials including adapted paintbrushes, spill proof cups, artist coveralls, adapted crayons, and blank hard back books with the desire to watch my special kids create a memory book about their school year.  Because of the broad range of physical disabilities my kids live with they struggle to access typical materials provided at school.  They need paintbrushes with adapted handles and cups that don't spill.  These modified materials allow them the same school experience as their non-disabled peers.  \n\nMy goal is to set my kids up for success.  I want to see them create art projects as independently as possible with the long term goal of completing individual ""My School Year"" books for each kid.  They will use the requested hard back books to mark milestones and memories from elementary school in a visual way.  This is best for many of my kids who due to their significant disabilities are non-readers. \n\nMy kids will have the opportunity to share experiences and memories that they are unable to verbally express to others.  The art materials give them the chance to shine.  Books are loved by all kids, but having a book, a real hard back book, that you created is VERY special!   "

Sharing student work and using real examples from the class during lessons increases engagement and promotes high-quality output. \n\nI teach 27 third-graders at a charter school in the city.  Many of them crave support and thrive on the attention given for their good work from their teachers and classmates.  They are eager to share and teach one another and love the encouragement and positive reinforcement that comes with showcasing excellent work.  Using student work to teach a lesson or reinforce content by pulling examples from among the class *as it is created* is one of the best ways that I have found to engage students in learning and encourage them to produce work of a high quality.  My students beam with pride when their work is copied and shared with their classmates as an example of ""what to do"" well.  Unfortunately, I have to wait a day until a class set has been copied, well after the ""energy"" of the moment has passed. We lose momentum by waiting and the copies are a necessary but wasteful use of paper resources, even when recycled or printed on ""scrap paper."" I also have to limit the number of samples. \n\nI will use the ELMO document camera and projector every day across all subjects to showcase student work *in the moment* to reinforce lesson material and provide other students with a visual model to learn from.  Being able to see a classmate's efforts (rather than a teacher's sample alone) at brainstorming leads in a writing piece, writing a step-by-step explanation of a math word problem, or drawing a detailed observation during a science lab can give an extra boost needed to others to get the job done.  The ELMO will enable me to grab and share student work IMMEDIATELY - as soon as I spot it - and create a culture in the classroom where good work or effort is immediately reinforced and used to teach others.  THIS IS EMPOWERING and makes every student feel like a SUCCESS!  Students remain engaged which is so critical in helping them sustain their interest in school and try their best. Instead of limiting myself to 1-2 student samples to copy, I can showcase all good work that I see! \n\nShowcasing student work in an efficient manner has been my goal all year long - I created a classroom blog in an effort to encourage and engage my students.  But there is no question that the most effective way to reach all my students is to use the strengths they bring to share with one another.  An ELMO camera and projector will engage them as learners AND teachers as they share their work and take pride in contributing to the learning community in our classroom. "

My students are very energetic and eager to learn. They love listening to stories either read by myself or by listening to them. The students have grown this year and are reading more each day. They are in a school where every child receives free breakfast and lunch. The parents try their best to supply what may be needed but it is difficult for many. Our school is a caring school with every staff member dedicated to doing what is best for our students. We not only try to help them while they are in school but after hours we try to make sure those who are in need for things outside of the school day are supplied with the essentials to keep them fed. When a family is in need our staff steps up to the plate to help them. \n\nDuring the day we have two times where the students find a quiet place to read. During this time we have included listening as an option for students. Students rotate during the two times of the day so that every student has a chance to be listening to stories. Students will be able to choose a story to listen to and read along with if the book is available. They will learn the different ways stories can be told, new words as they read along, and build their stamina for listening and reading. They will also learn how to be independent as they are to read quietly after their story is over. This is a special time for the students as they are able to choose their books to read. They choose their place to read and it gives them a sense of independence. With the choice of listening now added it gives them another way to learn to read and how to read fluently and with a voice. \n\nBy donating to my project you will give a place for my students to listen to their stories. The students will grow in their reading, stamina for reading and stamina for listening. They will increase their independent skills and gain an excitement for learning with another way to learn through both nonfiction and fiction stories on Cd's. "

The camera I inherited as a new journalism teacher at my school four years ago has finally bit the dust. It was junk to begin with, but the wear and tear of 20+ journalism students per year finally sent it packing to the dumpster. Now we're down to one camera. \n\nWe are very small, rural community that has a combined junior high and high school (enrollment of around 400 students). The students who would be using the new camera would be sophomores, juniors, and seniors who would be involved with Newspaper, Yearbook, Broadcast, or Online publishing. Currently, I have 17 students in newspaper and yearbook and another 11 students in Communications (broadcast and online). Other programs within the school (guidance office, library, and technology) use our equipment as well to cut costs. Our school ranks first in the county (of five schools) in graduation and attendance rates. We're known for our academics, not athletics, and it's important to the administration to offer the best education at the best cost. Therefore, our journalism department must pay for our own equipment. With ad sales dwindling in an area hit hard by the recession, our funds continue to get less and less each year. \n\nWith the full school year rapidly approaching, it means deadline season is just around the corner for my journalism students. A senior slideshow must be produced. A yearbook must be finished. A newspaper must be published bi-weekly. Our website must be updated daily. All of these require photographs of the students in our school system. To get the best photography, we need another high-end camera. \n\nWe currently have Canon lens; therefore, we must have a Canon camera body. This camera would allow us to continue to photograph sports and other school events. Right now, the point-and-shoot camera works only well for portrait shots and pictures where NOTHING is moving! We need something to capture fast movement. As you know, kids don't stand anywhere for very long. \n\nThis is extremely important that we can supply quality photos for the yearbook, newspaper, and other media. My journalism students need something new and that can be counted on for years to come. "

Though as with any student at that age, they appreciate structure and routines. It's exciting to watch their faces as folders and journals for a particular subject are distributed. Each day they are more and more excited about school. We have a phrase of getting smarter everyday. It's heart warming to have a child asked what they missed if they were absent. Having an opportunity to provide additional space for them to put their own materials besides their desks would allow my students to save projects that they are working on and any communication for home would be wonderful. Our goal would be to label the trays with names and photos. Assigning a couple of students to distribute materials to our ""mailbox"" would increase reading. Even though it's just a name at this age it is the foundation of letter recognition and letter-sounds. We all need a place to call our own and to develop organization. \n\nFor my students I am requesting a ""Cubby Storage Unit"". It is a mobile wooden unit with 30 slots which will accommodate the current class size of 27 first graders. Included are 30 clear trays. The trays are large enough to hold 2-pocket folders, books from our library, notes from school, and various assignments. Having a mobile storage unit is invaluable because it will allow us to easily move it to a location that would provide easy access for students and teacher. The removable trays also provides students to work independently or in small groups that they can bring to their tables/desks. As mentioned labeling each bin with a child's name and photo builds the community within our classroom while promoting name recognition as we learn one another. Also it will develop letter and sound recognition.   \n\nDonations to this project will be a benefit to the entire classroom for both students and teacher. Some of my students are pulled for special services and that generates additional communication and work that that child must keep up with along with sharing it with parents/families. Providing each child with their own tray will help keep us all on track and set a standard and awareness for anyone that enters our classroom that we like organization and structure.   "

Well, my students have that opportunity this year, if we can only find means to pay for their transportation to UCSB.   \n\nMy students attend a title 1 school in southern California.  These students are extremely motivated, hard-working, and love to participate in educational experiences, particularly related to science. They all live in a low, socioeconomic neighborhood where it is difficult for community members to make ends meet, let alone fine time to volunteer to fundraise or be able to donate to the school.  Therefore, they have limited means of traveling to other cities and visiting museums, planetariums, or other great hands-on learning centers.  Having the ability to go on one of these field trips would, especially to a university like UCSB would, in my experience, profoundly motivate many of them to increase their academic efforts and possibly even seek a career path in a scientific endeavor.   \n\nIf funded, the money donated for this class trip will be used to transport them via district bus to UCSB, where they will be joined by head chemistry lecturer, Dr. van Koppen, and a team of her graduate and undergraduate students.  These lucky fifth graders will have the opportunity to safely learn about chemistry in a real university lab: everything from experimenting with alchemy (turning objects into an alloy, brass, which resembles gold) to learning about states of matter and how they change, including the dazzling effect of sublimation, where a solid changes to a gas.  In addition to this, the students will have extra time to tour the UCSB campus, sitting in on lectures in large halls, visiting campus housing tracts, and taking in the natural beauty of the campus.  It is an experience that they will carry with them for their entire educational careers and beyond! \n\nMany students from this neighborhood have had little experience with higher education, and therefore feel that is is somehow unattainable, or out of their reach.  This trip, in which they learn about chemistry concepts of which they already have some basic knowledge, will inspire them to continue on with higher education.   "

Students earn the right to take film in their senior year when they pass the English Regents Exam.  They quickly learn that there are rigorous writing requirements including critical and analytical essays, film reviews and screenplay adaptations.  Most of the writing is based on the movies and film clips we watch in class.  ""Ay, there's the rub.""\n     In our typically overcrowded New York City Public High School classroom, our students watch the greatest films in cinema history on an olde 26"" Phillips television.  I have sat in the back of the room and from this vantage point it is virtually impossible to pick up the subtleties of dialogue through the TV's standard speakers.  However, the real shame is the loss of visual impact in a medium which is specifically created for the big picture.\n     The dynamic moment when Natalie Wood tells the teens to ""Hit the lights!,"" in the ""Chickie Run"" scene from REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE, when viewed in its widescreen letterbox format, is reduced to the size of an envelope.  Likewise, the breathtaking transition as the ape's thrown bone transforms into a floating spaceship in 2001:  A SPACE ODYSSEY might as well be viewed from the outer limits of the moon.  And the absolute wonder of Jack Nicholson's dancing eyebrows (which convey more emotion than most actors can with their entire bodies)is lost on a viewer straining his eyes to see Jack's from ten yards away.  \n     What I would love and what my film students certainly deserve would be a large widescreen TV with super sound.  To truly appreciate and understand the grandeur and nuances of cinema, frim must be viewed on a big screen.  A 42"" HD plasma TV would be a worthy replacement.  A 50"" monitor would be a gift to education that would keep on giving not only to these classes, but for countless students in years to come.

In addition, we would have a problem storing these.

Students can share papers or drawings they have created:  maybe a cartoon strip depicting the water or energy cycle.  Maybe watching an egg hatch would create a bond of a shared experience that would spill over into social development. It could be used in any subject matter to enhance learning.  Our students usually benefit from the smallest gifts in ways we never anticipate.  I think that is because they have so little by way of enrichment.\n\nThis one projector could open up so much for our students who rarely leave their neighborhoods.  The projector would get them to see how technology can enhance their senses so they can make more exact measurements and observations.  We have LCD projectors for computer images, but seeing something unfold in real life time like watching the water flow through a leaf you just picked or seeing the cells of their own skin would make such a huge impact on these students.  We could enrich these students in so many ways and the ELMO is the most cost effective way to give them these experiences."

With this new equipment, they can participate with tools that are reliable and numerous.  \n\nThis project is important to my students because it shows that people care enough to donate to our program. They will see that people believe in them when they don't get much help outside of school. Our school's physical education department has no budget, so this is your chance to help where we really need it. Every little change can make a difference, and we need the tools to create successful change. "

But in today's technology rich society, it is expected for college bound students that they can use a graphing calculator successfully. Many of our students cannot afford these calculators, but they need access to them. \n\nOur school has been in existence for over 50 years. As time has gone on, the surrounding community has become one where there are many low-income and high need students. We have many students with ambition and drive and many teachers who are dedicated to supporting them towards their highest potential. The challenge is that many families and the community as a whole cannot afford the support resources that the students need. \n\nI currently have almost a full class set of graphing calculators, but I still need a few more in order to have a full class set. Having a full class set would really benefit my students as then students would not need to share and each student would be able to understand how to access the technology. It is really true that in order to learn, you must do. Students who are not able to use the calculators have a hard time engaging with the learning content, and when the time comes to use the calculators to produce a result, usually cannot figure out what to do.\n\nThe other piece is being able to use the TI Emulation software-SmartView. Having this TI emulator to show the students what they are supposed to be seeing on their calculators will be invaluable. Being able to show them on a visual screen vs. holding up a calculator will make the learning process much faster and easier for the students. \n\nThis project is important because it will allow me to support every student to learn at a high level and give every student the same opportunity, where now, because I do not have a full set, some students are disadvantaged.

These tough, high-quality plastic squares and triangles, in several colors and sizes, have magnets built into their edges. The children use them daily to build houses, castles, and many other creations. The problem is the builders are often frustrated by the finite quantity of pieces. \n\nI'm requesting two additional large sets of Magna-Tiles. This will allow more children to participate, and to create larger and more complex constructions.  The children will have the means to let their hands and minds be as creative as possible.  Thank you for considering this request!"

They are little sponges that are soak up everything that they learn with smiles on their faces. \n\nThe whiteboards will be used everyday and kept in my student's desks so that they have access to them to support their learning. My students will be able to use the whiteboards for pre-writing.  This will make writing even more exciting and help us to reduce the amount of paper we use.  The whiteboards are magnetic so we will also be able to use them with  alphabet tiles to form words and sentences.  During art time while doing directed drawing we can use the whiteboards to practice our ideas.  The whiteboards will also be used to check for understanding when given a problem during math time. \n\nKindergarten sets the foundation of learning. It is important that we support students in being successful at this early age. These whiteboards will be used everyday several times a day.  They will support reading, writing, arithmetic and art.

This is the first year that we have included Forensic Science as an academic option. \n\nSince the first day of school, I have had students coming up to me asking: ""When are we going to dissect frogs?"".  Wondering if this was true of all of the students, I took a survey of who would/would not like to do this experiment.  113 out of about 120 students said they would like to do it.  I really hadn't thought about it for my class, but was prompted by their interest to make it a reality.  This spring, we will be doing a unit on anatomy, which will close out with the dissection.  My school has very limited resources, and has yet to order any science supplies for my class.  They are even more hesitant to put forth money for something, such as specimens, which are only used once.  With this obstacle, I have been hesitant to promise my students anything other than that I would try to get the materials. \n\nFor this project, I am requesting 60 frogs so that my students can dissect them in pairs with each pair having their own frog.

This year I really do not think it will be a possibility because all of our budgets have been cut. \n\nI don't want my students to miss out on this opportunity.  They love art, they love to paint!

Painting on canvas is something that they may not get to experience until college when you have to purchase your own materials for your studio classes.  I not only want to give my students this experience, but the confidence to achieve at the college level when they pursue art in the future.  It can be quite intimidating to enter a college studio without this kind of preparation.  At this level it makes sense for the students to strive for more advanced experiences that would influence their post-high school lives and I would like to help give them this opportunity.\n\nGiving my students the support that they need with this special project would mean so much to them!  Being given these materials would really take the art to another level for them.  Please help me give them one more reason to look forward to painting class!"

We want them to have fun learning math while they set their goals high enough to be in the running for a really nice prize. \n\n65% of the students in our Magnet School receive FARMS; 73.5% are African American, and the majority live in a suburban setting on the edge of the city line. Our school has a Performing and Visual Arts Magnet, an Environmental Science Magnet, and a Law and Finance Magnet. \n\nStudents need incentives in order to work to their maximum potential. One of the resources provided, the laptops, will be a large incentive toward which the students who succeed will earn a chance to win. The other materials such as quiz cubes, flash cards, hundreds boards, multiplication rap and CD, times math facts, wheel of facts, math stairs, and hardwood and folding geometric solids and other math manipulative items will, by their very nature, encourage students to work their hardest so they can use these wonderful materials. Our Principal's brother was noted for his exceptional teaching through the use of rap, which our Principal would like to emulate with the multiplication rap and CD. Students will learn how their refined math skills integrate into every phase of their lives and will carry this through into success on the MSA. \n\nOur students are intensely appreciative of fun ways to learn, and are motivated and encouraged by the prospect of winning something along the way. Not everyone will emerge as a laptop winner, but everyone who uses the math stairs, place value cards, the hundreds boards, the hardwood and geometric solids, the quiz cubes, factor frenzy, times math facts, the wheel of facts, rap and CD, and other math manipulative items will emerge with sharpened math skills to show for their efforts.

The smell of the ballpark.  My students experience none of this because our beautiful ball field is not utilized.  My students are aching to learn how to play baseball, and I'd love to teach them, but we don't have proper equipment. \n\nMy middle school students live and go to school in an under-privileged section of Washington, DC.  They really are very sweet and have an intense desire to learn. I have seen so much growth from them in the past year just in my area of social studies.  I love baseball and I want to help them learn to love they game to.  It saddens me when they say things like ""Mr. M, how do you throw a ball?"" or ""Mr. M., can you teach us how to play baseball?"" \n\nMy students love to learn and they love the concept of the sport, but part of being a teacher is providing them with the manipulatives and tangibles so that they can learn by doing rather than through hypothetical in-class demonstration. \n\nWe need baseball equipment including bats, leg guard, chest protector, score book, a base set, and catcher's helmet so that they can start learning how to play America's pastime after school rather than asking how to play America's pastime. \n\nThese materials will enable me to start a co-educational baseball team at the school so that my students can continue to forge out-of-class relationships with me and with each other.  We have a ballfield that my students have been asking me to use since August, but without equipment, I can't help them. For many students, this will be an opportunity to help build each other up through teamwork and to show what's it's like to be a part of a collective.  \n\nMy students are too often focused on individual gains and baseball is an ultimate team sport.  The team wins and loses together.  It's a critical part of any student's educational and extracurricular experience, and for many girls, it will provide them with a unique output for their strengths, especially in a community that can sadly be stuck in traditional gender roles. \n\nEvery student needs something at which he/she is good.  Many of my students are excellent in mathematics.  Many excel in reading.  Quite a few are good in the social sciences.  For those students who need an additional reason to remain in school even if they are struggling to maintain a C or a D, baseball can do that for them.  By allowing our school to have a team, we really can continue to help make a difference in these students' lives. "

Although this truly is a wonderful problem to have, it is difficult to keep up with books that meet my students' needs. \n\nMy students LOVE to read and write. I actually have students that want to stay in for recess to read and/or write! As with any class, my kids are reading on a variety of levels. I have students reading 2-3 years above grade level, and those reading 2 years below. All of them enjoy reading. This is largely due to the fact that our school district uses the Balanced Literacy approach to teaching literacy. Our students participate in daily reading and writing workshop, where the majority of time is spent applying the skills/strategies being taught during independent reading and writing. Teachers also meet with small guided reading groups in order to differentiate instruction. Our students learn, as early as kindergarten, to appreciate the love of reading. By the time they reach fourth grade, it becomes hard to keep up with them! \n\nMargret Peterson-Haddix is a favorite author in my classroom. My students can't get enough of her books! Her books are full of suspense and require a great deal of inferencing as students piece together information while reading. This is an essential skill for higher readers to develop. Often, it is the higher readers that are more difficult to push forward and challenge. The books that I am requesting are perfect for this type of teaching. Also, it is a challenge finding informational books that engage students reading at lower levels. These science readers are perfect for them! \n\nYour donations will enable me to better meet the needs of my higher readers, as well as keeping up with their appetite for great books!

Many students are children of immigrants who don't fully understand the American educational system and are ill-prepared to support their children in this area. I try to plant the seed that a college education is within their reach no matter what their background or perceived limitations. \n\nMy students often come to me with only a vague concept of what it means to take notes, or how to organize materials so they can be accessed when needed. Those who are qualified as ""gifted"" are often the most disorganized. Highly intelligent, and pulled in many directions at once by their interests and engagement in learning, they earn grades below their ability level because they lose assignments before they can be turned in for credit. Parents in our low-income area are frequently unable to provide their children with basic organization tools that could ensure their success. \n\nPutting the basics into the hands of each student empowers them to be professional students, developing the skills that will help them be life-long learners and allow them to visualize themselves as capable students with college in their future.

A three-ring binder with subject dividers allows loose papers to be saved in a similar fashion. When students know where things go, they are much less likely to lose them, and much more likely to have appropriate materials available whenever they are needed. Index cards and small post-it notes are invaluable study aids, allowing students to earmark topics and academic vocabulary (a particular need in our community) for future study. \n\nWith your help, our kids can become the professional students they were meant to be.

My students are on a comprehensive Title I middle school campus.  One of their biggest challenges is staying organized.  Throughout the week we set aside specific time to reorganize their materials.  I have found the most success comes from a highly organized classroom where each student has his/her individual place to turn in their assignments and where they are able to file their returned and corrected work. \n\nWhen my students have their assignments and supplies they are proud of their achievements.  Students are able to have a place to put their personal belongings, completed assignments, and graded assignments.  At our school, students are required to carry a three ring binder with all of their notes.  This was a challenge for my students as often they would leave their binders at home.  We have worked out a system where students are able to store their binders on the classroom shelf. When they have free time, it is their responsibility to update their binders.  From this, my students are able to have the same requirements as their general education peers. \n\nLearning the skills needed to be organized will not only help my students in middle school, but it will be a life long lesson that will help them be successful in their future.

We are integrating math video tutorials into our instruction to give students the chance to view the content at their own pace. We are now able to create specific tutorials covering the targets our students need to meet. Students are able to interact with the math videos as many times as needed to understand the content, and then complete guided practice problems to work toward mastery of the new concept. This method is efficient and creates accountability in students. The classroom becomes a place where the teacher is a facilitator of math instruction teaching through an inquiry based approach. \n\nAs teachers we are continually striving to meet the challenges of limited technology availability. Some students do not have internet access but have a computer. Other students have outdated computers or operating systems that will not download the teacher created videos. Others even have internet access, but are unable to open the videos from the class website. These students miss the opportunity to learn the content at their own pace. They need to use class time to learn the concept instead of having the opportunity to practice with peers and the teacher. Students become frustrated because they want to be able to learn the content independently, but are unable to do so due to lack of technology. Therefore, I am asking for several jump drives students can use. Math videos can be loaded on the jump drives for students to check out. Each day the current math video tutorial and guided practice can be put on the jump drives, so even without technology, students can access the content \n\nThe power of this project is the chance to give students the opportunity to be responsible for their own learning.

Everyday, I work diligently to change this belief. \n\nWith a severe decrease in education funding, there are currently insufficient resources to purchase relevant books and materials that will impact the lives of my students. As part of my goal to improve student literacy, I am working to connect the power of the video games that so many of my students play to reading into the classroom. I believe that novels based on video games, such as ""Halo,"" ""Mass Effect,” ""Diablo"","" ""Starcraft,"" and ""Warcraft,"" have the power to change non-readers into students working on increasing their abilities to read. These changes will lead to an academic skill to and belief in the idea of going to college.  \n\nIf sets of novels based on video games are purchased for my classes, my student will able to dramatically improve their individual literacy and develop as independent readers. Students with increased levels of literacy who choose to read are more likely to be interested in attending college. And, when they get to college, they are more likely to be successful. When students experience the appeal of books that can change a student’s perspective, this can create a portal of access and motivation for many marginalized students leading them to higher education in colleges and universities. As a teacher, my primary objective is to send my students to college as highly literate critical thinkers. But, my students and I need help. \n\nI know times are tough for everyone right now, but having sufficient resources can change students' lives. You can make it possible for students, teenagers without skill or desire to read, to enter the vital world of reading and to direct their future aspirations toward college.\n\n\n\n\n"

They will learn basic photo layout in a word processing program to bring their writing to publication. \n\nPhotography can make writing come alive. It can tell a story that will inspire students to tell a story in their own words.  These students will feel empowered to make a difference in their families and the community.

The resources at our school have been dwindling down for many years and now we are down to the very bare bones.  Few district and school resources are available.

It is a heavy burden to bear and I am asking for support so that my students can continue on a path of learning, growing, maturing, so that they can be the next generation of educated citizens. \n\nThe world is a place of wonder and a classroom computer will empower my students and give them the opportunity to access volumes of information in many formats which is lacking in some of our traditional textbooks.  Computer technology allows me a compact way to provide students with information and experiences that I cannot fit into our traditional classroom space.  Every topic imaginable can be accessed through the computer.  I believe in teaching children to be thinkers and problem solvers.  However, to do this in the best way, I need a networked classroom computer so my students can access the expansive knowledge our world has to offer. \n\nI have a strong commitment to inquiry and giving students ownership of their learning.

This student, like most of my others, is having trouble understanding the point of physics and the great demonstrations it can explained. \n\nMy students live in rural Mississippi, though their town is borderline small city size.  They are all African-American sophomores, juniors, and seniors at a school of over 1000 students, almost all on free or reduced lunch.  More than anything else, my students love to be challenged, and they love the personal pride that comes with overcoming the challenge.  Though their math skills are not as high as most high school students in physics, they have the ability to understand and do the math required for such an advanced class, precisely because they enjoy the academic challenge of it.  Because physics is such a challenging subject, my students respond all the better when they have their ""Aha!"" moments, in which they understand what they are doing and why. \n\nUnsure of how I could better convey the type of situations physics can explain, I returned to my high school physics teacher, figuring if he had inspired me to begin teaching, he could help me make physics more relevant for my students.  His students were covering Newton's laws, which they were doing with a really neat experiment in which a student was pushed across the room in a chair, and software was used to graph the student's velocity vs time, from which his acceleration was calculated.  From there, students went into a discussion of how the situation would have changed given a smaller student, a larger kick, etc.  Inspired by this demonstration, I went back to my school and did one similar, minus the technology.  Sometimes I think that is the story of my students' lives.  While they understood the concepts, my students missed the opportunity to practice the calculations and immediately and quantitatively see the results they had predicted. \n\nMy students are very bright, but they often miss the opportunity to see how schoolwork impacts their everyday lives and how it can be turned into a career that is both challenging and interesting.  They are lucky to live in a time when this type of technology is offered, but they have yet to benefit from it.  Bringing sensors and software to my students will help them understand when we use physics.  It will offer students who are already interested a way to be challenged more and more engaged. "

Besides technology, an iPad would also help my students in academic areas, such as, mathematics and science.  Having iPads in the classroom will create motivation for my students.  They will all want to use this technology.  There are many interactive apps that could be added to the iPad to help my students in various math and science concepts. \n\nYour donation will benefit a class of very well deserving fourth graders.

Many of my students do not have age appropriate books at home.  Your donation will enable me to create an age appropriate, child centered library in our classroom.

They are very driven young men and women with interests ranging from the legal profession to the medical field. \n\nMost of my students have been in AP classes their entire high school career, and some are already taking college courses. They also have a wide range of interests and abilities outside of the classroom. Many are student-athletes. They hold down jobs and are in a variety of clubs and organizations at our school. \n\nOur school is one of the largest in our state with a population of over 2,100 students. We are in a warm weather location and consequently, our school has a very diverse student body comprised of students from the local region, the northern USA and many international students. \n\nMy students will be representing our state at the National We the People Finals in Washington, D.C. An understanding of that program and the competition is the best way to know what my students will learn. The requirements on my students will be tremendous as this process demands they excel in a number of academic skills. First, students must understand how to research beyond ""fact finding"" and they must ""own"" their research. They must work with a team, they must write concisely, yet profoundly, and they must possess strong oratory skills. With all that in mind, my students will have an in-depth knowledge of the constitution and will be able to communicate it a mock congressional hearing. \n\nI commonly describe the difficulty of competition by saying these students must provide a thorough application of historical and current constitutional law to judges who have been professionals in their fields longer than my students have been alive. \n\nDonations will change my students' lives in two ways. First, those donations will allow the team to see their nation's capital. After studying our government this year, their knowledge will be exponentially deeper with a first-hand experience of Washington D.C. Secondly, the donations will allow my students the great honor of representing our state at the We the People National Finals. That is a responsibility they welcome and they do not take lightly. Any donations will be greatly appreciated. "

My students lack the funds to truly experience Chicago's history and sites.  \n\nAs a public school teacher, I am blessed with the opportunity to provide my students with new experiences. For a lot of my students, the classroom is the only place they can experience life outside of their neighborhood. The 3rd grade students in my class are scared to go outside of their homes because of the rival gang fighting that exists. Besides the gang fighting, the students do not have a lot of money. Both situations make it difficult to leave the neighborhood.\n\nA very small number of my students have actually visited the historical sites of downtown Chicago. In order for my students to understand the opportunities waiting for them outside of their neighborhood, it is my job to take them there. A historical tour of downtown Chicago on a trolley will be a life-changing experience for my students. \n\nMy students have been studying the history of our great city for 3 months. They will get to see many historical sites in Chicago. I have taken 5 3rd grade classes on this trip in the past and they always tell me that they will never forget it. They tell me it was the best part of 3rd grade. Watching their faces light up when we pull up to the Sears Tower or visit the spot where the Chicago Fire started is truly unforgettable.\n\nPlease help change the life of a very deserving student. These children have such great potential. They are smart and currently very motivated, but lack the resources to know the opportunities that are waiting them in their future. You can help me make their future brighter. Every child deserves this much. "

My students enter my classroom with varying degrees of needs and abilities-some are non-speakers of English, while others are orally fluent in more than 2 languages. Because I work with a large population in very small groups, I have the opportunity to really focus on the individual learner. \n\nAs we work during each school year to become better readers, writers, listeners, speakers, and thinkers in English, we need a variety of skills to achieve that success. Reading English is the most important skill in school, and students have to be efficient at it. Providing an environment where students can maintain their focus and increase their reading ability will help them reach their fullest potential in every aspect of their life.\n\nOne way that I will help my students become successful is to provide them with individualized, oral language practice, every day. I strongly believe that a student who can speak out loud without concern that others are listening will develop better reading abilities. My students will be free to respond to and read aloud in their lessons if they are each wearing headphones.\n\nThrough computer technology, their learning environment is enriched by using several varied and challenging programs to meet the individual stages of reading.  My language lab, once equipped with headphones, will be a safe and productive place to improve their knowledge of phonetics, sentence phrasing, vocabulary, and all other skills involved with reading.\n\nOnce their ability to read reaches at least grade-level, students will then have the opportunity to use the language lab and the headphones to experience more complex activities and lessons to grow and challenge their individual knowledge base. For example they can be exposed to academic videos of their choosing through United Streaming, an on-line, leveled, academic video archive that I already have a membership to use.\n\nThe addition of headphones to an environment that is all but ready to support learning, will successfully fulfill this need and allow my 60+ students to have what it takes to learn to read more effectively.  \n\nThank you for your consideration! Your support is vital and extremely appreciated! \n\n"

These are questions I hear from my students throughout the day. \n\nMy students come from diverse backgrounds including two parent homes, single parent homes, and students who are being raised by their grandparents.  The personal, social, emotional and educational needs of my students vary.  My students who have family support are quickly able to learn their multiplication facts.  However, some of my students are not privileged to educational learning opportunities outside of the classroom. \n\nI know that my students are expected to know their multiplication facts in order to be successful mathematicians. Students who know their multiplication facts can apply this knowledge to algorithms, problem solving, and daily living skills with ease. \n\n In my classroom I hear students asking for the answer to these multiplication facts on a daily basis, which hinders confidence, self-esteem, and success in reaching the correct answer. The multiplication wrap-ups I am requesting are hand held manipulatives that allow students to learn multiplication facts quickly through play and self-checking techniques.  The CD rap songs that accompany the hand held wrap ups help move students towards mastery of these facts in a fun way.\n\nThe wrap ups are small and therefore students can take these resources home for additional time in learning their facts. \n\nWith these manipulatives I have requested, I hope to help my students wrap up multiplication facts so that they will become successful users of numbers. With this small success comes greater success for math mastery. "

They also face the fact that at home parents are unable to offer them much help because they don't speak the language and don't have the means to buy them a computer or a tablet.  They are very motivated to learn and they love technology.  My school is limited when it comes to technology.  I have 17 students and only 3 computers.  So this makes it very hard to use the computer daily for research, practice, ect.  I know that by offering them the technology necessary during reading and language arts these students would definitely learn more and be enthusiastic about it.  A projector and laptop would solve the problem of teaching the reading series which is 100% digital.  \n\nI am requesting a projector and laptop because the reading series is 100% digital.

Without a projector and a laptop students sit uncomfortably looking at one little monitor on the computer to read or practice these skill.   \n\nMy project is important to me because I can offer the students the help they need in reading and language arts.  This project will have a tremendous impact on the students because they will be more motivated to learn since they will be able to visually experience stories and hear them better as well.  They will love to watch stories on a big screen instead a small monitor and this motivation will transfer to their everyday lives while acquiring a love for reading. "

(Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Math) They are gifted in many different areas including science, math, reading, writing and the arts. \n\nMy students are working above grade level in academics, but are emotionally and socially 6, 7 and 8 year old children. They love all activities which are hands-on, and science, math and engineering are among their favorite subjects.\n\nMost of them are avid readers, and they all have very active imaginations. They are extremely curious, have fluent and flexible thinking, are very observant, and they learn quickly with very little repetition. \n\nMy students have elaborate and original ideas and they quickly and easily see relationships in ideas, objects and facts. Our classroom is like the world: busy, chaotic, and always in motion. \n\nStudents are provided with science books to read to learn about science. Books are wonderful, useful, and teach so much, but when it comes to science then students should be able to explore concepts firsthand. \n\nAre students really going to learn how a plant grows by reading about it? Instead, if they are able to read about it and actually go through the scientific process by planting the seeds and watching everyday to see what happens, and tracking the growth and development, their understanding will be at a much deeper level. \n\nI want my students to take away something important from every lesson every day. Growing a plant in class will allow students to learn in a fun and exciting way. It will provide them an opportunity to lean in a way that will be different and meaningful. "

Having these books in our classroom will provide my students with the resources they need to continue to be engaged in our independent reading program.,"My students need 27 high interest books by authors such as Scott Westerfield, Gary Paulsen, and  Sharon Flake in order to keep my students engaged in independent reading.","Where are all the good books?!?"" is a question I am frequently asked while my students are choosing books for their independent reading project.  They are motivated to reach their reading goals this year, we just don't have enough high interest books to meet their different interests.  \n\nI teach seventh and eight grade language arts at a low-income urban school in Missouri. At the beginning of the year my students claimed to hate reading because they had never experienced reading a book they were actually interested in. For many of my students that all changed when I introduced them to high interest short stories.\n\nNow they are more willing to read, however, they often struggle to find books they are actually interested in. As a result, many of my students have become book hoppers that start a book, get bored with it, quit reading, and then start the process all over again. In order for my students to be able to practice the skills they have learned in class we desperately need books that can grab and hold their attention. If they are able to have books they actually want to read from beginning to end they will be able to apply higher level thinking skills like analyzing the plot and character motivations. \n\nMy language arts classroom is very data driven and this year our big goal is to increase our reading goals by two years growth. In order to do this we have begun working on an independent reading projects where students are able choose a book at their individual reading level. Since every student is then practicing reading at their own level then they are continuously pushing themselves to grow as readers.\n\nThe key to making this reading program successful is getting my students to actually WANT to read by having book options that appeal to their various interests. The books this project is requesting are books that the students have specifically requested.  Having these books in our classroom will provide my students with the resources they need to continue to be engaged in our independent reading program. \n\nI have some of the hardest working students I have ever met. They desperately want to read, but reading is simply more enjoyable when you actually like the book you're working on.   Your donation to our classroom will provide my students with books that would otherwise be impossible for us to have. With your help we can work to close the achievement gap for these amazing students. "

They need a fresh start. \n\nMy students enrolled in continuation high school when they fell behind in credits or had other issues that interfered with their education. They are disenfranchised and feel powerless. Traditional schooling did not work for many of them; this is their last chance at school.  \n\nThese students are interesting, creative and bright, but many of them have long forgotten that learning can be (and should be) fun.  When I met with them the first time and told them they’d be sharing their writing as we got to know one another better, S. said, “We don’t do that here.” But, the next day, he shared a six word memoir he wrote: “My intentions don’t match my actions.” Writing together is helping all the students grow and change. \n\nIn order to make an impact on the world, students need to learn to develop their own voices, their own stories of who they are in the world, why they are who they are, and how they can contribute to the common good. When we read a poem by Zoran Hawez, an Iraqi refugee, my student R. wrote a poem in response. In tears she said, “I’ve got somebody at home I have to read this to.” \n\nThis sparked a conversation where she told me about being moved from Oakland against her will, her out-of-control behavior, and the reason for her tears in class. “She (my mother) just wanted to keep us safe.” It was a moment of realization that inspired this project. As the students develop their voices through writing, they grow in their understanding of the world. \n\nWe need a variety of books to spark my dtudents' imaginations, a digital camera and flip video camera to capture images to create their own personal and powerful digital stories. Digital storytelling gives these students tools for telling their stories to a larger audience, increasing their skills for the 21st century and empowering their lives. \n\nResearch participants that we’ve studied in class found personal as well as community transformation grew as a result of their work. Providing provocative text allows students to explore and critically reflect on their lives. By pairing a collection of high-interest books with our writing work, and adding an element of digital storytelling to the mix, these students will be poised to find their voices,change their destinies and make a positive impact on their communities.

They live in a small town and many do not have opportunities to travel. Looking through my reading surveys, I was surprised at how many students did not have books in their home available for them to read. However, most of my students have an iPod or some other form of mp3 player available for them to use in their home.  I want to use this technological powerhouse to provide my students with many varied opportunities to read.\n\n \n\niPods give me an opportunity to show my students another avenue to read through audio books and/or ebooks.  This will give my students an opportunity to read books that they would otherwise not have tried because they 'have too many pages' or 'my friends will laugh at me because I have to read this book'.  To a teacher those last words are so troubling.  \n\nWith an iPod, I can level the playing field allowing my advanced readers and my below level readers books that will improve reading skills on all levels.  \n\nHowever, reading books is not the only advantage I will have with iPods in my classroom.  My students will have access to the many educational apps out there as well.  There are apps for everything that my students face---raising a lower reading level, learning English as their second language, but above all these apps will allow my students to have fun while learning. \n\nBy supporting my project, you will be providing a level playing field for my student's learning.  You will be giving them opportunities to learn that will not cause them embarrassment, but will open their eyes to new opportunities.  You will allow my students to believe in themselves, and give them the opportunity to make it all the way to SUCCESS! "

","What was it that inspired your love of reading? For me it was books that I could personally relate to, and books that met my needs by feeding my interest. Please feed reading habits for 8th grade students in a rural town! \n\nStudents live in a small friendly rural community that has grades Pre-K to 8th grade. Due to our tight knit school the older students, the 8th graders, sometimes feel as though they are treated like a younger student. By having books that fit their interests, needs, and cater to an older thinking I can help the 8th grade students know that I understand their need to want to be a young adult.  \n\nWith the books I am requesting I will be able to cater to some of the requests students have made for reading. I will also be able to help support some of the reading material I already have in the classroom. For example, the text Delirium was bought for a student and she loved it so much that she has shared this with others and many are requesting to read the sequel (which is on the requested list). I will not only help support life long reading habits, but I will be bolstering new reading habits for many of the students. \n\nI have recently found that when I find a text that speaks to a student that student will talk about the text to others, such as their parents, siblings, or friends. In turn, these people then ask to borrow the text. This brings on a domino event of reading and everyone is learning while they read, discussing the books with one another causing actual conversation!  "

These center activities are for grades 1 - 3 for enrichment lessons when needed.,"It's important to keep all students challenged at all times so these materials will provide hands on practice for the students that are ready for more.  All children need to be challenged every day at school, so it's important to have multi-level material available for all students. \n\nMy students are very thoughtful and some of my advanced students would love to spend their time helping other students to complete their work. I'm proud of their caring nature, but I want them to be continually learning. I don't want them to spend their time helping others because they are not challenged enough during independent work time.  \n\nMy students,  teachers, families, and the community at my school really foster this caring attitude.  It's a wonderful attitude but I want all of my students challenged throughout the day. \n\nWhen I am working with small groups, I really like to have fun center activities for my students to enjoy.  They feel like games but in reality they are learning tools that really enhance my program.  These learning games are very colorful and exciting and it is so much more fun for my students to work on than worksheets etc.  Also the leveled activities ensures that I can quickly change the activity based on the students' ability levels.  Therefore my students are working at their ability level and they experience more satisfaction and make progress more quickly.   Teachers have a limited amount of time to work with students in small groups, so these materials are really essential to ensure that students are working to their highest potential at all times.  These games are self checking so that the students can successfully work independently. \n\nFirst grade is the foundation of a student's success in school.  Can anyone put a price on what it means for a child to learn to read?  First grade is the year that students need to read to access the curriculum.  It's essential that they read.  They have to read the questions in math etc., so their success in school depends on it.  Also when donating to a school you know that the items will be used year after year, and your one time investment will reap rewards for years to come! "

They live in the inner city. Educational researchers have found a strong correlation between reading and vocabulary knowledge. In other words, students who have a large vocabulary are usually good readers. This is not very surprising, since the best way to acquire a large vocabulary is to read extensively, and if you read extensively you are likely to be or become a good reader! \n\nReading non-fiction in English is probably the most important, but English fiction and any reading in the mother tongue - if done extensively - will help your child develop the reading competence that is essential for academic achievement. \n\nWe need new books, including Curious George, Benjamin Banneker, How Do Dinosaurs Go to School? and more, to stimulate literacy.

This will relate to actual forestry practices that determine tree length and log production. \n\nMy students will be better able to understand environmental concepts and practices as a result of this project. They will participate in ""doing"" science which I feel is a valuable component to environmental science. "

I currently teach a 4th grade inclusion classroom at P.S 48, ""The Best School in the Universe."" An inclusion classroom is a mixed ability class. About 1/3 of my students require special needs such as occupational therapy and speech services. My students often lack self-confidence and because of this they often lose interest in school, simply because they have told themselves that they cannot do it. I am constantly looking for activities as well as learning games that will keep them focused on learning. \n\nLast year, I was able to borrow a Leap Frog pad from a fellow teacher to use in my classroom. I was truly amazed at my students' response to this educational game. It helps to boost their confidence in reading because they are able to use the pen and read along. \n\nA Leap Frog pad will aid them in spelling, it will improve their vocabulary usage and, most importantly, it will help with fluency. In addition to reading the Leap Frog pad also provides books in other subject areas such as Science and Social Studies. This is important to in creating a well rounded student. I know that my students will benefit greatly, simply because I have already seen results.\n\n"

""Who really invented peanut butter?"" ""Where did clocks first come from?"" These and questions like them come up all the time in my classroom. We like to stop and to look them up on the Internet, but right now that's become increasingly more difficult. \n\nLike all students, my class is most eager to learn when the topic is something that interests them. I have 21 students in a combined second and third grade classroom, so it is a challenge to meet their vast array of needs. I use technology to help capture the students' interest and meet their individual needs.\n\nOur school is very small with just 57 students in three classrooms. We are a Title One school with an approximate 65% poverty rate. Our school is the center of our rural community and everyone agrees it is just like a large family. \n\nOur classroom is blessed to have a presentation set. A presentation set has a data projector connected to either a document camera, a laptop, or both. A complete set also has an interactive white board. We are fortunate to have all these components, which I use every day in instructing my students.\n\nUnfortunately, no technology lasts forever. The laptop in our presentation set is nearly seven years old. It has had several updates, but it has seen better days. Right now our laptop takes so long to start up that the children get restless. It is this piece of our presentation set I am hoping to get replaced.\n\nWe would use the laptop to look up those spur-of-the-moment, fascinating questions the children have. We would use it to play learning games on the interactive white board. I could show PowerPoints I have prepared. Finally, I would use it to show students how to do things on the computer before we go to the computer lab, especially how to use the features in Microsoft Office Word. \n\nIn our rural part of West Virginia many students do not have access to the Internet at home, so we try to make the most of it at school. Technology is not only engaging to the students, but will be an integral part of their lives and future careers. Having this new laptop will impact nearly every aspect of my students' school day with interactive games, technology instruction, and quick access to information on any topic we like. "

My experience as an inner-city orchestra teacher is that my students get hooked to playing in the orchestra by a beat as well.  Last year I started a new strings program at an elementary school where every student in the 4th-7th grade learned the basics on the violin.  My students were very receptive to the change in curriculum from a vocal to instrumental focus.  The goal for this year is to hook them in by adding a rhythm section to our violin orchestra and then eventually add the rest of the stringed instruments. \n\nMy school is the perfect setting for a thriving instrumental music program:  eager students that love music and extremely supportive parents.  Unfortunately, we have a very small budget and no effort was made in the past to acquire instruments through other means, so our supplies are very low for the number of students we serve. \n\nA drum set will complete our rhythm section and provide motivation for those students that would like to play percussion, while giving our orchestra a groove that captivates both students and parents alike.  Once the initial momentum is built using hip-hop and pop, students are more receptive to playing and learning about other genres, including jazz and classical music.  I know my students will be so excited by the addition of the rhythm section and very eager to start preparing for our first performance of the new school year. \n\nI have seen music unite schools many times as students form a bond with their instrument and each other through the orchestra.  Your generosity will put us one step closer to our vision of an orchestra that brings our students together in friendship and teamwork while they discover the joy of making music."

Many, however, don’t even have this.",My physics students need scientific calculators (and I need an eficient way to store a class set).,"Physics!  \n\n...Scared?  \n\nMany people – of all educational and socioeconomic backgrounds – are afraid of this math-heavy science.  \nI teach at Clyde C. Miller Career Academy, a magnet school in St. Louis Public Schools – a very high needs district.  The vision of C.A. is “Every Student Career and College Ready.”  To this end, all students are required to take four years of science, which means that I teach physics to more than 50% of the senior class.  (The other students are in other upper-level science classes.)  The majority of these students will indeed go on to four-year universities, which all require at least one class in the physical sciences.  It is my goal to give these first-generation college students a leg up by ensuring that, in at least one core class, they are just as prepared as the average student from a more affluent background.\n\nPhysics is hard for most people.  Now try doing it while being grade levels behind in mathematics.  Try doing it before learning right-triangle trigonometry.  Try doing it without a calculator.  Some of my students have been able to invest in scientific calculators; others can use the calculators of the math department, but only while in math class; some try to make do with simple dollar-store calculators.  Many, however, don’t even have this.  This has actually made my students surprisingly proficient at long division and multiplication; trigonometry, however, requires the use of calculators to determine the sine, cosine, and tangent of angles.  Thus far, students without calculators have borrowed them from friends – or, as often happens, simply gotten the answers from them.  During tests, I have been forced to allow students to share calculators – an awkward and inefficient process.\n\nFor this reason, I am requesting a class set of scientific calculators.  Not only will it allow students without calculators to have access to them, but it will open the doors to teaching technology in the classroom:  If everyone can have the same calculator in front of them, I can formally teach them all how to use them. (This would be much better than the status quo, which involves me trying to navigate each student’s calculator one-by-one to show them how to use it.)  To facilitate this, I have also requested a holder for them.  This way, I can assign each student a specific calculator to use in class, and can keep track of what calculators are in and out of my possession.\n\nBy funding this project, you will be empowering future first-generation college students to learn the skills NOW that will be so critical in nine months, when they enter the “brave new world” of college for the first time.  In addition, you will be providing other science classes access to these calculators, so that younger students can begin to get familiar with this most basic piece of scientific technology."

Our school community includes many children with a variety of exceptionalities.  The children I am writing this proposal for are the ones in self-contained classrooms. Currently, our school has four school-aged self-contained classes of children who have autism. \n\n     Autism is a neurological dysfunction that mainly affects communication and social areas. Sometimes these children have other disabilities or disorders along with autism, such as Tourette Syndrome and Mental Retardation. They usually have sensory integration problems. Some have obsessive-compulsive behaviors. While some can imitate, many need hand-over-hand assistance. Some children with autism are non-verbal. They may or may not use gestures. Others are verbal, but do not always understand everything they can say. \n\n     Music can be a very effective way to reach these students. I will be striving to get them to move to the music, dance, freeze when the music stops. I use pictures, gestures, and try to get the children to imitate. I work on action songs. Some will be able to do these things independently; others will be hand-over-hand. We will work on holding and playing musical instruments, but there is more I can do as an educator. \n\n     I would like more educational materials that will allow me to integrate music with the teachers' educational goals, such as colors, shapes, body parts, reading and mathematics readiness. I plan to keep these materials and instruments in a portable container to easily transport between the music room and their room. Approximately 32 children would benefit from these instruments and materials. We have to reach these kids as early as possible, as education is the key to maximizing these students' potential and helping them to become productive members of our community. Please help me with my goal. \n\n     The materials I am requesting are mostly classroom percussion instruments which can be easily cleaned and disinfected. They include drums of various sizes, shapes, and colors; a rainstick, wrist and ankle bells, a tambourine, a jingle stick, small wood claves, a woodblock, a clatter-pillar, a small triangle, a mini guiro, castanet puppets, mini maracas, and different kinds of shakers (made of various materials and shapes) which require different kinds of grasps. A Go-Jo Bag is a tactile shaker with velcro that adds weight and provides sensory input. I would also like to have easily cleaned vinyl bean bags and a book / CD called Activities and Coordination Skills. The other CDs and books I would like provide opportunities for movement (animal walks, action songs); music promoting reading readiness, songs about color recognition, and mathematics (counting, addition, and subtraction).\n\n     Every child can improve with early intervention. These children with disabilities need a lot of repetition, but also enjoy new music. As their music teacher, I can provide them with singing, dancing, moving, and playing that will bring joy and enrichment into their lives. By integrating music with their educational goals, we use multiple intelligences to enhance their learning.\n\n     Please consider this proposal for our school's students in self-contained classes. We would appreciate any assistance you can give us. Thank-you.\n\n   "

The instruments are in many cases in disrepair and unable to be played. Our musicians need your help! \n\nMy students began an instrument in the band program with me when they were in 3rd grade.  I have some amazingly talented musicians in the band!  Some of them have challenged themselves at the young ages of 9 and 10 by playing a solo in front of a judge to receive a rating.  Many of those youngsters have done this more than once and received the top ratings numerous times!  I have students that have been selected for county-wide events due to their talent and hard work.  These students have done all these amazing events without the requirement of buying their own expensive instruments- we have provided that for them from the school.  As these students move from the elementary school to the middle school, however, these dreams and accomplishments may be lost for them.  Middle school is a difficult time!  Help these students continue with something they already know and love- band! \n\nOur middle school band program needs new French horns.  There is currently one French horn in very bad shape in the inventory, and there will be at least 3 students moving up from 5th grade to 6th grade who have already demonstrated their talents on the French horn.  These students wish to continue playing their beloved instrument in the middle school, but there might not be an instrument there for them when the arrive!  We all remember the trials and tribulations of middle school- these students shouldn't have to worry about losing something they love when they get there on top of that!  Give these students a chance to have a wonderful experience in the middle school band with instruments that are appropriately sized for them, as well as more advanced for their higher level of musicianship. \n\nThese new and more advanced instruments will last for many years to come in the middle school band!  Students should not be faced with the expensive cost of this important instrument.  Please help my advancing musicians continue with the band program they love, playing the instrument they love!  Help us get these French Horns!  Thank you so much for your support! "

This is the first school experience for many of my students and they are hesitant to try new things and need my examples and help to complete many types of activities.  They gain their confidence by completing activities together and being praised for their effort.   \n\nWhile using the document camera I will be able to project whatever manipulatives and/or activity we are using on my large white board and demonstrate the concepts we are currently working on.  I then would have them use the manipulatives or complete the activity using the document camera which would allow me to assess their understanding of the concept. They then would complete the activity at their seats and anyone who showed a need for help would continue to work with me until the concept is mastered. \n\nI feel a document camera would be a great asset to our classroom because it would make every activity interactive and it would keep students on task. It would really help those children who aren't able to sit and do paper pencil work a chance to get up and move around. All students would be so excited to be able to interact with the activities in this way! "

Aside from learning how to decode and comprehend text, my students will also learn the importance of fluent reading. \n\nI teach five year old kindergarten for a small elementary school in a small district in Wisconsin. My students come from diverse ethnic backgrounds and from various socio economic statuses. My kindergarten students come to school each day eager to learn and excited to spend time with their teachers and peers. A large part of our mornings is spent doing literacy related activities. My students particularly enjoy being read to and participating in choral readings of familiar books. They also like listening to stories on cds and retelling familiar stories with puppets and other materials. \n\nKindergarten children are learning the importance of the printed word. Aside from acquiring new knowledge of phonemic awareness and how to decode and comprehend text, new readers must also understand fluency- how to read fluently. As a kindergarten teacher, I have the important job of modeling fluency for my students as well as providing opportunities for them to practice reciting text, play with print in books and hear favorite stories read repeatedly. \n\nThe resources that I have requested will enable me to provide many opportunities for fluency instruction. I have asked for big books to allow my students and I to enjoy stories together through my reading out loud and choral readings. Books/cd sets will be used in our various listening centers so children can enjoy stories as often as they like during our literacy block and choice times. And reader's theater/puppet materials will allow me to create lessons for my students that encourage them to recite texts from poems and stories. \n\nThese new materials will be a great asset to my ever improving instructional arsenal. Using fun, new tools not only motivates me as an educator but creates an excitement in my classroom. I am amazed by how much my students learn in the nine months they spend in my classroom. Many children begin kindergarten with some letter/sound knowledge and finish the year knowing how to read! It's an awesome job being able to teach someone a skill that they will use every day for the rest of their lives! "

The book bins will be a great organizational support for students to use during reading rotations to grab their book bins and move around the room and to store their books they are reading in their bins to access easily as they are reading and working around the classroom. Lastly, the marker boards and organizational stand will be a great resource for our writing center and math centers in order for students to work out their math strategies and for students to study their word work. \n\nThese items will make a great improvement throughout our classroom by having a steady and organized flow within rotations and transitions.

They come from backgrounds were they do not have much exposure to arts or materials.  It is a luxury for them to have a pack of crayons, much less materials for printmaking's. These students are excited about art and I want to incorporate some of the common core standards to help them learn. They are struggling with have the basic materials needed to teach. My students are willing to learn, they just need the right materials to help inspire a change. \n\nFor most of my students a box of crayons is a luxury.  Many of them do not even have crayons at home.  The idea of making one thing that can turn into several different artworks is beyond their grasp at the moment.  This project would help my students see how one picture can change just by the color that is used to make a print.  I want my students to be able to see how hard work can communicate through their art.  \n\nWith these materials students will be creating a pop art print that goes with current culture.  They will be thinking about what information they want to communicate with this print.  Each student will use the Styrofoam sheets to create an image.  From this image they will be able to make multiple pictures in different colors.   They will learn that art can be used to communicate information just based on the color you see. \n\nMany of the materials will be used by future classes for the same project.  The barens, brayers, and mixing tray will be used by future classes.  \n\nThe project will have a huge impact on most of the students.  It will allow my students to connect their current culture with a new material that they have never seen before.  It will help them understand how color communicates information.  The majority of the materials can be used by future classes so this same project can be done for years to come.  This donations will change they way my students look at a piece of art and show them that one drawing can have different meanings. "

This project includes the books that were lost.  \n\nAt my school, we are making great gains in reading. This additional funding would allow me to extend their learning even further. My students love books. The books I have chosen are books they are interested in. They absolutely love to read books by Mo Willems and they really enjoy the Fly Guy series. They can relate to the characters and enjoy reading together. When they like what they are reading, they are more likely to read the books time and time again. With a wide variety of reading materials, learning can be differentiated based on the student's needs.  \n\nThis project is very important because it continues the work we have started in our class. We read together each day. Having an own opportunity to read a story on their own after we have read it together as a class is a great way to build story comprehension and fluency.

My students love to include photos and interesting graphs in their projects and without color, photos, and graphs lose their beauty. \n\nMy students are from low income families and they often cannot afford to purchase ink for their home printers, if they are fortunate to have one at home. Now that the school has wireless connection, I allow many of my students to use the laptops to work on their assignments in the classroom.  With a wireless printer it will eliminate the need for wires to be hazardously placed throughout the classroom.  The color ink will also bring life to their projects and will make them feel proud to have their assignments displayed as the students meant for them to be. \n\nPlease help bring this resource to my students.  I have worked tirelessly with my core music students to have them create incredible projects on composers like Bach and Beethoven, great jazz musicians like Charlie Parker and Duke Ellington, different genres of music and musical theater.  Bringing this wireless color printer and scanner will bring so many opportunities to the classroom for these well deserving students. \n\nBy bringing this HP Office jet into the classroom, my students' work will be brought up another level.  You will also be a contributor the success of my students by donating such an important item to the classroom.

We are very unique, but we all have one common goal: to learn as much as possible and to HAVE FUN DOING IT! \n\nIn addition to the range of abilities of my general education students, I also have special education students in my classroom. Many of my students are faced with the challenges of low income backgrounds and have few opportunities available to them. \n\nDespite our differences and the obstacles we must overcome, we are a great group of learners who are seeking the most from our educational opportunities and trying the absolute best we can be! \n\nI am requesting a new book shelf to store our classroom library. We have had so many books donated to our library this year that we just don't have the space to store our books anymore. Our classroom only has one book shelf that was intended for a Kindergarten classroom. \nSince all of our new books have arrived we are in a serious predicament! Books have to be double stacked on the shelves and this prevents my students from seeing all the books our library has to offer. My students are missing out on reading experiences and magical childhood memories because they can't currently see all that is available to them. \n\nThis project is important because we are running out of space. We need a durable book shelf that will last for years to come. We need to be able to organize our learning materials based on the lexile level of the book as well. When books are organized by their lexile levels, my students are better able to challenge themselves. Please help us! "

I recently joined my students after they have had a long term substitute since September. When I assessed the classroom resources, I found much lacking for basic instruction, most specifically, the essentials for learning to read. \n\nOur school is located in the beautiful North Carolina mountains and we enjoy the rich Native American heritage of our community. Students in our classroom come from a variety of backgrounds, but have one main similarity: they are all served through Special Education. We have children with Learning Disabilities, ADHD/ADD, processing impairments, and more who all love to learn in our room!  \n\nCenters are an essential part of learning to read. Students in our class will benefit greatly from the independent listening centers I develop using the literature and CDs in this project. Also, we enjoy learning our letter sounds and names each day, but do not currently have a pocket chart or stand. By donating to our project, you are providing students with a place to organize letters/sounds as well as begin putting together words and sentences. There is no greater gift you can give a young child, than that of literacy! \n\nThe students in my classroom had a rough start to their year with a long term substitute serving as their teacher. Finally, they have a certified educator in their classroom full time, but still need the tools for success that are offered in the other classrooms at our school. I can already see the sweet smiles as reading becomes a reality for these students who work so hard to learn each and every day! I thank you in advance! "

This means, not only will my students lose the opportunity to experience the impact of a large collection of art work displayed in one location, but also the chance to experience the joy of their own creations in an exhibition. They have missed out on seeing groupings of art works matted and displayed in a professional manner. \n\nIf I can't take my students to the art gallery, then we will create our own! My students have talent and enthusiasm and they deserve to have their art work seen by their peers, parents and members of our community. \n\nI want them to take on the role of curator, not just artist. I want them to plan displays, advertise the show, create invitations and act as docents for a Visual Arts Exhibit on our campus. I believe this project will give them a sense of pride and accomplishment. \n\nTo give their works a finished, professional touch I need mats.

These will be the steps students will go through to complete the project.\n\n1. Describe the superhero by his/her appearances, powers, background, family, and enemy(s).  \n2. Draw the character.\n3. Create a storyboard about the character.\n4. Design the cover for the superhero comic book.\n5. Paint the cover.\n6.

Just as somebody in the past created ""Superman"" and ""Batman"" in their head, this would give my students a chance to create their own.  Who knows, one day, their superhero could be made into not only a comic book but a movie? \n\nMany students think that it is other people's job to be creative and famous with their talent.  Why should it be so?  In America, anybody could be the next ""star"" artist, designer, director, etc.  With this project, I would really emphasize that these famous people now were at one point ""nobody"" and that they all struggled in the past.  However, with perseverance and determination combined with skills and talent, they all could become successful in their chosen field.   "

My district is unable to fund enrichment opportunities like the classroom aquarium I am requesting. \n\nThe advantage of funding my proposal is the opportunity to provide my kinesthetic learners with hands-on science. Many of my students cannot learn solely through textbooks, especially because the majority of them read at early primary levels  and our school's textbooks are not at an appropriate reading level for them. By feeding the fish, observing them, testing the pH level of the water, and many other fun activities, my students will become enthusiastic science investigators. \n\nBy funding this project, you will provide a real life study of science and many hands-on daily activities for between 40 and 50 special education students. By giving my students this wonderful enrichment opportunity, you will be giving them the education that they need and deserve to be successful students in a high poverty urban school district.

They will get to choose what story they want to listen or choose a literacy activity that also comes with the kit. My students enjoy being in charge of their own learning so they take charge of things they need to work on. My students voted for this project because they know the importance of becoming excellent readers to become what they want to be when they grow up! \n\nIt is statistically proven that students become better readers the more they are exposed to reading and also how often they are read to. I read a story a day, but imagine if my students had the CHOICE to listen to reading as many times as they could during a day. It is also so important for my ELL students to listen to reading and gain fluency and confidence in their language. When I asked them what difference these materials would make they said "" We will love reading more than we already do!"" "

There is so much out on the Internet for the benefit of students.  My first graders would really benefit from the vast amount of visual and audio materials on the Internet and other computer programs. \n\nMy first graders are wonderful children.  Most of these children eat free breakfast at school.  Also, they qualify for free or reduced lunch at school.  These students want to be very successful.  However, due to the plight of the inner city in which they live, these students experience crime, poverty and poor living conditions.  School is a safe place for them.  They feel safe and welcome in my classroom.  My students need to know there are caring people in the world that want to help them succeed. My students need a confidence boost to help them be willing to learn more.   \n\nHaving a computer projector in the classroom would directly benefit my students.  I would be able to engage them in stimulating lessons through the use of PowerPoint presentations, books on the screen, or Internet educational movies.  Most of these teaching resources are available from the publishers of the curriculum books we use in the classroom.  Having the ability to project important concepts on the screen would help my students remember the ideas better.  After all, it seems this generation focuses on watching things that are fast moving.  Having a projector would be a huge asset in the classroom that would help my students engage the curriculum materials better. \n\nI have been very fortunate to get several projects funded from wonderful people like yourself.  Having this project funded for a projector would  be a very fulfilling reward for me as a teacher and for my inner city students.  I would be able to increase my level of teaching to provide better resources for my students.  You can help my inner city first graders by supporting this critical proposal for a projector.

The calculators I am requesting help algebra students model and collect data from experiments just like engineers do. They can then analyze them to discover the algebraic patterns within the data. \n\nWe are an urban school in a medium-sized city in Virginia.  My students are in grades 7 and 8.  We have a good mix of races, cultures, and socioeconomic status within our student body.  Our city is a first-stop for many refugees coming to the U.S.  As a result, our students speak over 20 languages.  The parents of my students are involved and interested in their children's education, but often they do not have a lot of education themselves, or do not speak English, which impedes home-school interaction.  \n\nMy school division is committed to closing the achievement gap, and we've been comparatively successful when looking at surrounding school divisions.  We actively search for non-Caucasian students to learn algebra in middle school rather than waiting for high school, and offer these students supports outside of class as needed in order to help them succeed. \n\nThis summer, I had an opportunity to work with professors and graduate students at a local university. The professors were building low-power sensors to be used in medical devices. My job was to design learning modules that tied into the goals at the university. Since I am an algebra teacher, I focused on using sensors (rather than building them) and designing circuits, and analyzing the data.  \n\nThere are many sensors students can use, but they need an advanced calculator to collect the data. My division does not have the calculators, and they have no money with which to buy them.  \n\nI attended at TI-Nspire training this summer at my own cost, and acquired one calculator there. I bought one other calculator on EBay, again at my own cost. With the four additional calculators I've requested, I can have my students work in small groups, each with their own calculator. They will have the chance to work with these wonderful tools at an early age to understand the math-science connection. \n\nI was inspired and energized while experiencing the math-engineering/science connection this summer.  What I'm trying to do is unlike anything I've done in my 20 years of middle and high school math teaching.  I want my students to be similarly inspired, not only by my class, but also to perhaps pursue more STEM activities in future years.  I thank you for your consideration of my project. "

In addition, they will understand the economic concepts of supply and demand and how it affected the lives of different people living in California during the gold rush. They even get to eat a forty-niners lunch to help students understand that life as a forty-niner wasn't so easy after all.  \n\nHaving such an incredible experience will help my students go beyond the textbook and really make history come alive for them.

Some live in shelters, have no coats, come in hungry, dirty, etc.... We are a public school with the NYC Board of Ed. The school ranges from Pre-K to 8th grade. It's a shame public schools do not have enough money to have adequate supplies for our kids. My class LOVES to read and they even write about their favorite stories. This is where the wipe erase boards come in handy. Since we don't have a lot of paper, we write our thoughts on the boards. \n\nOne of the things I like to do is to leave out a book I have read to the students, so they can enjoy it. It's an amazing thing when you watch 2 or 3 classmates enjoy a book together and it is so special when no one can hear it but them:) Then, there are activities that will be added to the listening center recordings - songs, comprehension questions about setting story sequencing and characters. The dry erase boards will help the students to mark their answers with words or pictures. The dry erase boards are such a great tool because it can be used in every subject. Kindergartners have such a good time drawing with a marker; they fight over the 4 boards we have in our class. They will learn independence, listening skills, writing, organization, comprehension...the list goes on. \n\nThis would make such a difference in our early childhood classroom. You take for granted what other schools in better areas have until you experience a day with students that want to learn but don't have the tools.

I really try to be a great teacher and this would make my job even better because my kids would be thrilled.\nThank to for reading. Happy Holidays! "

Using this technology will inspire students to think critically as they analyze the data they collect. At the same time, they will be learning the required water chemistry that allows life to exist in the water. They will come to understand that human activity around the river can alter these conditions. Another way to determine water quality is to conduct a biotic index. To do this, students will use dip nets to collect and guides to identify the types of organisms that currently live in our river. \n\nPlease support my students in learning about their surroundings and the consequences of human activity.

This is where those cordless microscopes would be so beneficial.  \n   The extra supplies of both regular and depression slides, and the stain kit will enable me to add in more techniques in microbiology and histology for my students during this unit, as well as replenishing my current dwindling supply. It will allow me to continue this unit for the next couple of years at least which shrinking budget in our district would limit.  \n\n     Every year my goal is to offer my students the best lessons and curriculum I can, and as a science teacher offering hands-on activities, experiments and labs is paramount to a successful science classroom.

They attend a public preschool for a variety of children with special needs.  We share our school with a YWCA preschool class as well.  \nWhen children are identified (usually at around 3yr),they come to us for intervention. More importantly, their parents come for information, guidance and hope.  \nOften our kids come in with no real connection to the world. They are occupied and monopolized trying to deal with their bodies.  Our class focuses on making connections, first with the adults in their world and at some point with the other children.  It is my goal to help them enjoy the environment outside of their bodies and to make connections with people. \nThey are wonderful little people with unknown potential when they arrive. The most exciting part of my job is to help them connect with the world. The amount of progress they make during the 2 years they are with us is always an amazing gift. \n\nAll of the items requested will allow my students to alter the way their bodies feel.  Most of the items help calm over sensitive or reactionary bodies.  Weighted items help provide a feeling of calmness.\nChewing items can be calming or stimulating (depending on the child), as well as, organizing to their central nervous systems.  \nVarious textures help provide stimulation, as well as, organizing various sensory systems.\nVisual tools, such as the timers, help children understand a sense of time in a way they can literally see and understand. \n\nAs my children learn how to feel comfortable in their bodies, they will be able to access their environment. When this happens, they can learn better, both as an individual as well as in groups.

They have an insatiable thirst for knowledge and love to relate science to the outside world.  They are particularly fond of the class animals we currently have, a bearded dragon and a freshwater aquarium filled with tetras, gouramis, a plecko, and a loach.  They are the ones who thought a marine tank would be of interest and a great comparison to a freshwater tank.  This simple request resulted in the creation of a Marine Biology course to be added to school's curriculum to begin next school year. \n\nThere are very few people who do not appreciate the beauty and uniqueness of a marine aquarium.  Imagine having that in a classroom.  The tank would be filled with live rock, invertebrates, and colorful marine fish.  Students would be able to observe on a daily basis a marine environment, conduct water quality testing, and make comparisons to a freshwater tank. \n\nThis is a unique opportunity for middle school students to participate in a Marine Biology course. The purpose of this course is to not only provide enrichment by introducing a topic not normally taught in middle school and developing an appreciation for the largest ecosystem, but to possibly get students to consider attending a regional aquaculture school and pursuing a career in Marine Science.

I know some aren't really seeing well and worry about the ones who give up seeing at all. \n\nI know a projector is a lot to ask for, but it's something I promise to put to good use with my students. When we're discussing topics, I forget they don't know so many basic things, and a projector would allow me to be able to show all of them!

Using the visual presenter will save on average approximately 200 sheets of paper per day. That's 1000 sheets per week which totals 36,000 sheets per year. That's a lot of paper and that's just for one classroom. Photocopies will not have to be made, which not only saves paper but toner and time as well. Also,less paper use means less trash which helps the environment as well.\n\nIn addition to helping us become a little ""greener"", as a business teacher, a V.P. will enable me to share news articles with my students helping them become more knowledgeable about the current state of affairs. Ultimately, affording them the opportunity to become more informed about what they can do to help turn things around. \n\nAs students research current events, a V.P. will allow them to share and discuss their findings with the class in a much more meaningful way. The student presenting will be able to speak confidently and the students watching can listen with confidence because all the facts are right there for all to see. \n\nToday's youth is tomorrows future. As educators, it is our responsibility to provide our students with as much information as we can to better prepare them for that future. We need to empower them so they can enter the career world with their eyes wide open. You can help open their eyes and keep them from being blind sided by supporting this Video Presenter project."

Interactive notebooks will help the kinesthetic student prepare for the Common Core Standards. \n \n\nMy students come from a variety of demographic backgrounds.  Since our school is a designated Title I school, many of our students do not have the money to buy materials they may need for class.  Numerous manipulatives and strategies are used daily to ""shake things up"" and ensure the desired daily outcomes. Regardless of our efforts, there are still students who struggle to learn basic writing skills, because they fear failure.\n \n\nInteractive Notebooks are a format for taking notes that encourages organization, making connections, and interaction. This tool will enable students to be creative, independent thinkers and writers. Students should use the right side of the notebook pages for testable material: notes from class and group discussions, reading, video and audio presentations, lectures, as well as literary terms, vocabulary, and assignments. \n \nThe left side is for reading responses and journals, graphic organizers, connected or related ideas, reflections, quotes, perspective, mnemonic devices and memory aids.\n\nI will provide the notebooks, but the sticky notes will help make the notebook information more interesting and attention getting. We will include a variety of elements in the notebook. The highlighters will help my special needs students identify material to study and the Post-its will help the students create tabs for the different units of study. \n\nOur project is important because Arizona is at the bottom of the list for per-student spending.  This project will help engage students who may quickly lose interest in reading and writing. Our supplies are limited, but our students' potential is not.  Please help our students stay interested in their learning and stay on the path to success by funding this project. "

In my experience, students always enjoy chalk pastels and these same materials could also be used in future events when the students could create murals on the cement floors as a ""Chalk the Walk"" project. \n\nMy students need these supplies to help provide a well rounded education.  The chalk pastels are a medium that students are not always introduced to and these supplies will help the students in the diversity of their arts education. "

English matters.  Education matters.","My students need 28 copies of ""Class Matters"" to make connections between our non-fiction unit and some of the themes they have been analyzing and debating in literature.  ","My students lost everything in Katrina, and analyzing literature is the last thing on their priority list.  When prodded to read or write, many say that English has nothing to do with the rest of their lives.  So I have to be more engaging; I have to show them that good analysis isn’t just for English, but necessary for life. \nToo often they have had English teachers tell them what a story is “about,” they have memorized it, and the unit ends with their regurgitating the “answers” on a test.  That’s not engaging, and it certainly doesn’t teach them analysis.  I won’t tell my students how to interpret literature; instead, I teach them the skills to analyze it, find their own meaning, and of course, use evidence to prove their interpretations.   Similarly, save for stressing that they must always show respect to everyone around them, I won’t tell my students how to think; part of becoming an adults is learning how to think for yourself.  Students begin a literary work by respectfully debating the “bigger questions,” that I’ve extracted, by using their own experiences as evidence. By the end, they use examples from the texts, situations the characters encounter, and text-based analysis to answer the bigger questions (themes).   By beginning with debate and analysis of their own lives, students not only practice using evidence in a less-threatening way, but they also become personally engaged, and understand the relevance of the discussion in their own lives.  Also, they learn how to engage in conversation, for I directly teach rebuttal: you can’t say, “that’s stupid,” or “you’re wrong,” but you can say, “I disagree and here’s why…” \n\n\n      Although I’m thankful that we have textbooks, they are better used as an occasional resource than as the entire curriculum.  I spend too much of my own money buying books, and trying to find texts that will engage the kids and help them improve their reading levels, improve their analysis, and actually empower them to consider themselves readers.  The librarians have been fantastic resources with fiction, but I’m left at a loss for non-fiction.  I want to continue the progress we’ve made, and to do it, I need better resources.  Because the book “Class Matters” sets the stage for powerful discussion and debate, and because it aligns with the “American Dream” theme that has inspired the most enthusiastic class debates and analysis this year, I want to use it as our non-fiction text.  Especially now that the students are intrigued with analysis, I want to help them see the relevance of the thematic discussions we’ve had within the literature so that they can see the same themes reflected in the world around them.  English matters.  Education matters.  And them understanding the connections between education, class, and the rest of their lives matters most.  \n\n\n     And so I ask you, dear donor, help these students make connections between the analysis techniques, that they’ve finally come to embrace, and the real world.  Help them apply their new skills, and help them understand these questions are bigger than just some book, and that the implications will resound throughout their lives, especially if they turn their backs on their education.  Help them to think as educated individuals.  "

My students come from mostly middle income families with 2 working parents. About one fourth of my students are from single parent homes. We have 3 military bases in our community so about 35% of our students are from military families. Most of my students participate in various extracurricular activities such as football, soccer, dance, basketball, karate and gymnastics. They are eager learners and love to read and are working to improve their writing skills through our daily Writer's Workshop. \n\nRecently during one of our Writer's Workshop lessons I read the book, How I Became a Pirate, by Melinda Long to teach my students how important it is to ""hook"" your reader at the beginning of a piece of writing. The book was used as a model to show how an interesting lead can make a big difference in our writing.  Having Melinda Long visit my students to share her expertise will have a greater impact on them since they are familiar with her books. She will share with them the writing process explaining how a picture book is made from the beginning stages to the actual finished product.  They will learn that writing is an actual process and there is a great deal of revising and editing involved.  Revising and editing is a very difficult concept to teach young children because they think once its written it's finished! I would like for them to hear that from an actual author and not just their teacher. \n\nAll of us remember times in our young life when something or somebody had a profound effect on us and we never forgot what we learned. Through this opportunity my students will learn that being a successful author requires work and commitment.  Many young people today do not have role models to teach them these values. Hopefully through this project my students will gain more knowledge of the writing process and give them the confidence to believe in themselves as writers. "

It was a great success. All students explained that the pictorial reinforcements were paramount in helping them comprehend the nuances of the text and sequence of the plot. Furthermore, students took the initiative to analyze the graphics and offer the symbolic importance of colors, character features, and setting during class discussions. They loved the intensity the graphics added, and they appreciated the accessibility of a modern edition of the play.\n\nAccordingly, I request that you help support my need for additional copies of graphic ""Macbeth"" as an integral part of my school's new curriculum so that I can begin to introduce the graphic novel genre to incoming freshman through the lens of a timeless masterpiece. Donating to this project will help prepare my students for college; they will read a canonized classic and lay the foundation for studying English in the realm of higher education. \n\nI am excited about the graphic versions of Shakespeare, because they do maintain the original language, which is only enhanced by the intensity of artistry. ""Macbeth"" in graphic novel form is a treat for any reader, and it is important because it engages students in the act of reading and then in the act of performing; they become as entranced with the play as Macbeth does with the Weird Sisters after his prophecy begins to unfurl. \n\nI urge you to make a difference in the lives of children who have endless promise and potential. The lack of funding for city schools has been detrimental to small, new schools, which are trying to move education in a progressive and student-centered direction. The budget works against bright futures, which are student futures. These students deserve interesting forms of literature to read, and our book-room is sparse - fill it with Shakespeare and love for this next generation!\n"

Today, it is amazing where the technology is and going! \n\nThe document camera could be the best piece of equipment that would come into my science classroom by far! With the document camera, students are able to see the science experiment or demonstration with clarity right from their seat, even in the back of the room! The head tilts to view these activities from all angles and can zoom in to see it up close and personal. We no longer have to hold up the paper and point. We can simply put it under the document camera and every student can visually see and follow along. We can even save images to use later! The best part...students can work or demonstrate problems or do experiments using the document camera and every student can see and participate with no problem. \n\nTechnology can sometimes be very frustrating, but the rewards it brings to the classroom is priceless. With your help, let's take the price tag off their education and give them every opportunity they deserve! "

I would like to have color because the kids can easily refer to it and there is data they retain information from color paper more so than with plain white. \n\nThe goal is that my students will grow by the end of year and will be on grade level in math. I want them to believe in themselves and achieve their goals. With that being said, they will succeed.\n \nBELIEVE, ACHIEVE, SUCCEED!!!\n "

Our campus, while culturally rich in its diversity, is its own city of a population of five-thousand students who move through the quad and corridors like the old time ""Gangs of New York,"" spewing vulgarity atop insults garnished with threats.\n\nMy aspirations  to deliver a lesson on tolerance has been in the wings for a few years, but due to the nature of our campus environment it is risky business because of the high gang activity in and around our campus. I think Maus, however, given its genre and use of anthropomorphism , will reduce the tension between the opposing gangs to allow discussion, and its strong thematic message of intolerance and hate will set a standard that they can think about throughout the year.

Dialog in editorial cartoons often uses the kind of language that the characters would actually use. For example, if the characters are children, the dialog might include slang or if the characters have accents, the dialog might reflect that. Dialog is one way to capture a person’s true voice, as well as their strong feelings.\n\nAfter reading Maus students will work with a partner to create a cartoon that points out the dangers of hating an entire group of people.  \n\nYour donations to this project will commence my long awaited dream to begin the school year with lessons on tolerance. Many of my students cannot walk down the street without the hyper-vigilant eye of survival. It is our responsibility to teach them the rewards of tolerance, so that they have a choice to live without fear and hatred. After Maus we will then read Elie Wiesel's memoir, Night, and finish with a field trip to The Museum of Tolerance, if funds permit. Thank you! "

Kids want to be entertained at home and at school. I recently discovered that readers theater is the answer to my problem.  \n\nI work for a public charter school in southern California.  Most of my students come from homes that do not have an English speaking parent, which can make it difficult to get extra reading help. Their parents do want the best for their children, but unfortunately can not always provide it for them. Parents are constantly asking me for reading material for their child to take home (for reading logs) and will bring their child to school early to ask for help with questions or problems that they could not answer. My students love to learn and have this thirst for knowledge that I feel responsible for enhancing.  \n\nLast year I taught the second grade for the first time. I was having some trouble inspiring a few students when it came to the topic of reading. One day I came across a readers theater download and decided to give it a try in my classroom. To my amazement it not only worked, but I saw my classroom come to life while my students were reading their lines in the script. Students were reading with intonation, personality, and fluency. My students even began to argue because they all wanted a part. If we were to receive these materials, I could work in small groups to ensure that all students would have an opportunity to read and learn. Having reader theater scripts at the beginning of the year would ensure that I will have students who read with fluency, personality, and love. \n\nPlease help me to inspire an awesome group of kids this year. These scripts will help to create life long readers. Readers theater not only makes kids read, but it also entertains them, which is the key to keeping their attention. We thank you for your support!

The document camera would project a clear image of students' sharing their work during math or a beautiful paragraph from a student's writing draft.  Students can learn so much more from seeing examples from their peers.  The speakers would allow us to better hear video and audio segments from our laptop, which would help the students be more fully engaged and ensure that everyone can actually hear.  The fraction lab set would help those students that learn better by manipulating materials with their hands to fully understand one of the hardest math concepts they will encounter this year.  All of these supplies will help reach out to all the students, allowing them to learn in a variety of ways. \n\nYour donation will make a true impact by allowing the curriculum to be accessible to each student.

Our school is a Title One school which includes students who are considered high poverty and at risk of not graduating. \n\nMy students must work twice as hard in order to meet the same accountability standards as their native English-speaking peers since they are learning the English language while simultaneously studying core content subjects.There are several benefits to language learners from social online communication,such as more opportunities for expression and meaningful discourse than in face-to-face discussions, greater linguistic production overall, more student engagement, and more multidirectional (versus teacher-centered) interaction. The biggest problem related to English-language learning is not so much developing oral-conversation skills, but gaining academic written-language skills.One of the things that has been shown is that when students talk about things in online discussions,they use more complicated vocabulary, because it is easier to see what's been written by others and incorporate it into their own writing. My long term goal is for each student to have a tablet for classroom use. \n\nThe tablets will provide increased differentiation, efficient assessment, increased student access to the teacher, and most importantly helping my students become successful academically and socially. I would like to create interactive video mini lessons to increase both differentiation and student access to teachers. I will utilize Google Forms, e-Clicker and Edmodo to create a faster feedback loop for assessment (allowing for same-day differentiated groupings based on exit tickets),and also to allow me to tailor assessment questions to individual students. I would like to have technology based reflections, mood check-ins and student-teacher blogging. This will help make each student feel more connected to me,increase their trust and make each child feel ""heard"" throughout the day. Instead of replacing paper math games with flashy video math games, I want students to create their own math videos, write math blogs and conduct Challenge Based Learning math projects. \n\nMy students spend most of their day listening and not interacting with the language as much. Technology can mix things up,captures students' attention,and engage them in a way traditional classroom instruction does not.

I have approximately 150 students and almost all are 9th graders. About 85% of my students African American, 10% Latino, and 5% Asian or white, and I also serve students with special needs and students learning the English language.\n\nOne of the true marvels of modern chemistry is the synthetic polymer. We know of polymers as plastics, but a polymer is an extremely large molecule consisting of thousands and thousands of small units that all link together, like a chain. Polymers have resulted in things like plastics, unbreakable polycarbonate glass lenses, nylon, bullet-proof vests, and countless other materials that have revolutionized our society. In our study of chemistry, a survey of polymers could be an engaging, interactive, comprehensive unit, going well beyond what the students did in their 8th grade class and providing them with an opportunity to get a hands-on look at an amazing branch of chemistry.\n\nThe materials I am requesting in this grant proposal are all chemicals from Sargent-Welch, a popular supplier of middle school and high school science supplies. The chemicals ordered will be used for teacher demonstrations in front of the class as well as for individual student explorations with polymers. The lab activities will allow the students to actually synthesize their own polymers and explore their properties. These hands-on projects would be used along with an advanced but conceptual study of how polymers form, biological polymers (nucleic acids and proteins), an analysis of the different types of plastics, investigations of what types of plastics can be found at home, and discussion about the recycling of plastics.\n\nThe two paragraphs in our textbook regarding polymers that my students probably read last year do not do justice to the polymer chemistry that has had profound effects not only on chemistry, but on society. Giving my students an in-depth and hands-on opportunity to explore a real world application of chemistry will be a positive experience. Not only will it give them successes in a new and unique topic, but it will get them that much more invested in a subject with which they often struggle."

Spanish materials are hard to...",My students need more books in Spanish and a listening center.,"The Latino student population at my school lags behind in test scores. We are supporting them in many ways, including having a Spanish language immersion program. Spanish materials are hard to find! The more books available translates to more reading done by my students. \n\nMy school is a Title 1 school in the state of Washington. 70% of our student population receives free and reduced lunch. We have a high number of Latino students, and a high number of students who have recently arrived in the United States. This is the fourth year of our language immersion program, which provides some of our students with literacy instruction in Spanish in Kindergarten and 1st grade, and math and science instruction in Spanish in grades 2 through 5. The Spanish immersion class consists of 60% native Spanish speakers and 40% native English speakers. Our school values diversity and since the language immersion program began we have seen an increase in close relationships among students of different language backgrounds. Our school is an open concept building (meaning that there are no walls between classrooms). This has allowed both the Spanish and Mandarin language immersion classrooms to affect not just the students in those classrooms, but also those walking by. \n\nI teach Kindergarten and 1st grade students in the Spanish language immersion program. I loop with the same group of students for two years in a row. I am their literacy and social studies teacher. All of their literacy learning is done in Spanish. Many of our students come from homes that are not rich with literacy. We focus many of our efforts on family involvement and an increase of literacy awareness. The materials asked for will allow my students to hear other Spanish speakers (besides the teacher), exposing them to a variety of accents. The materials asked for will also allow my beginning Spanish speakers to have books that they can actually read themselves. Being able to listen to the books will enhance the students' enjoyment of the stories. They will be able to listen to their favorite stories during the independent work time while the teacher works with small guided reading groups. This is a key component of the literacy block. \n\nMy resources in Spanish are limited. I have 56 students that I see each day, and am in need of many books that are accessible to them at their current reading levels. Part of reading success comes from having many books available at the students' independent levels. The students greatly enjoy listening to stories and would like to be able to provide this for them in a better way than the systems I have used in the past (CD players that sometimes work). My goal is to get my students reading more! "

My students are actively engaged in our daily curriculum and encouraged to find new ways to show what they have learned. \n\nCreating products to demonstrate their learning allows students to express themselves and share their findings in new ways. My students love painting about a story they have read. They love using stamps to create a storyboard for a writing idea. They love making posters about the skills they have learned in math. Art is a wonderful way for my students to share. Our problem is the art supplies we currently have are depleted, old, and drying out. We are in need of replacement brushes, paint and paper to help us continue to be creative in our learning. \n\nYou can help us express ourselves. Your donation will give my students the materials they need to continue to find creative ways to show what they are learning. Help me foster their creativity so they don't lose it! "

My class includes students who are already dreaming of careers in science. I also teach students who are just learning to love science. I am always seeking ways to make science relevant, exciting, and real. \n\nOur school is the largest high school in Portland Public Schools. We are known for our strong programs and extremely involved student body. In my classroom, students can further explore biology and get lots of college-level experiences along the way.\n\nMy students are juniors and seniors with at least two years of high-school science behind them. Many are increasingly interested in science and a number of my students have applied for science internships next summer. \n\nThese materials will be a central part of our spring labs. \n\nIn doing this work, students will analyze DNA from 3 members of a fictional family. Based on their DNA fingerprinting results, they will determine how a particular gene is passed through that family. In RNAi portion of this lab, students will ""Âknock out"" a gene in a microscopic worm. They will see how the absence of this gene affects the worms. They will then extract DNA and study the genetics of healthy and affected worms. This will involve a technique called the polymerase chain reaction (PCR).\n\nIn completing this lab, students will learn not just how to use advanced molecular equipment, but will answer compelling and current inquiry questions by using these techniques. \n\nI'm all about using hands-on experiences to open students up to science. If students learn about science by doing it, they will become more curious, more willing to work their hardest, and will see themselves as scientists. \n\nThis lab is a culmination of a year's worth of research, which has included an evolution inquiry that included students working with a scanning electron microscope, genetic inheritance labs with fruit flies, and an upcoming lab on transforming bacteria with plasmids.

I want to allow my Kindergarten and 4th Grade buddy class to express themselves this way- through art. \n\nMy students live in a beautiful part of California, with rivers, mountains, and rolling hills all within view.  Although our school is located in a suburb, the students come from many different neighborhoods.  Some come from sprawling homes on several acres, some share a small home with multiple generations, and others live in apartments.  This rich diversity makes our school special and unique. \n\nProviding a sketch book and a portfolio for each student is just the beginning. With the art materials, I will be able to teach the students specific artistic techniques.  One day, my students will practice sketching with charcoal and blurring the lines with a smudge stick.  Another day, we will use tissue to create a collage.  Yet another day, we can take our materials outside to recreate the nature around us with oil pastels.  These materials will allow me to introduce a form of expression that will enrich my students' lives.  Hopefully, my students will begin to appreciate the artistic elements in the world around them and see themselves as artists as well. \n\nLet's face it, in these difficult economic times art education is not a priority for many people.  These resources will enable me to incorporate art into my students' everyday lives.  Not only  will they  learn about specific artists and techniques, they will learn to appreciate the balance of colors in a garden, see the contrast of dark and light along a fence line, and experience the pleasure of losing themselves in the process of art.

It is very relaxing for them to play with water and it cools them down enough to be able to be outdoors for a longer period of time.  We use the time at the water tables to use different types of containers to measure the amount of water each one holds.  The children have a few toys to use, such as a water wheel and they are able to see that water is very strong and can make things move rather quickly. They use their imaginations as they pour water into cups and pretend they are drinking tea or juice also plan to introduce sea animals at the table and increase their knowledge of sea life. \n\nWater is very soothing, and I plan to use the water table as a stress release for children that are very stressed when they have to be separated from their parents.

All of the students in my class come from low socioeconomic backgrounds and have very little at home support with homework and school readiness skills.

As well as apps to develop and build math skills and hundreds of books for students to have at their fingertips.  Having an iPad in the classroom for my students to use would nearly double the effectiveness of our intervention time.

I had a great experience with the Kindles in my classroom last year, and know this device will help facilitate that. \n\nI truly believe that reading is a vital skill that most kids do not do on their own time.  I used to think EReaders would discourage kids from reading actual books, but I was wrong. Once they found out that they actually enjoyed reading, they were very open to checking out the book that came next. I feel that I need to use technology to show them another reading source. "

Moreover, 100% of the students are living at or below the poverty level. I teach 6th grade Math and Science. My students are in a dual language class and they receive their academic instruction in Spanish. My students have a great desire to learn and will often arrive to school early to complete their research projects. Resources for my Spanish students are quite limited and they often rely on learning from the Internet because they don't have money to go on trips to local museums or faraway destinations. \n\nMy students work in teams and will use the tablet to enhance their classroom instruction. Through project based learning, my students will be intellectually challenged and use problem-solving skills as they work individually and in teams to locate, process, and synthesize information they've found online. The tablet will offer my students ways to experiment and observe current scientific innovations and apply them to their classroom learning. Also, students will have access to experts' research, analysis and images. The students will then synthesize the information in their teams and then present their findings to the class. The two tablets will provide my students critical access to the web. \n\nThe tablets are a technological innovation that will keep my students engaged and on task, reducing behavioral problems in the classroom. Students will learn how to analyze information and how to work in collaborative teams and present their information.

A terrarium containing carnivorous plants will make ecology lessons realistic, and small plants and potting supplies will allow students to maintain plants in lab, using the soil pH meter to discover their initial pH, as well as track changes in pH over time and when simulated ""acid rain"" occurs in the environment. \n\nThe liquid pH meters will allow us to stop wasting pH test strips and will last through years of environmental and integrated science classes. The additional supplies will enable our class to run more smoothly, and allow me to give students the opportunity to take more responsibility in lab situations. \n\nBy helping bring life into our classroom, you will allow my students to see a ecology as a living science, and engage them in environmental studies with feverish enthusiasm. Students will be provided with the ability to grow and maintain a plant under various lab-created conditions, and my students would be quick to point out that you are also providing us with additional oxygen (photosynthesis!). Your help will engage our classroom on a deeper level, and I truly appreciate it! "

This is true for all age groups, but especially for middle school.  As a culminating project for our poetry unit, students are asked to share their work in front of their peers in a safe environment. \n\nMy students are not used to succeeding in the area of language arts, especially in creating original writing.  Many of my students have limited home exposure and reinforcement in the area of academics.  When introduced to poetry and given the opportunity to journal and brainstorm their writing, many find an outlet that they can relate to and embrace the activities with optimism and enthusiasm.  After watching a poetry slam performance, many students wanted to share their work with their peers but were very shy and timid in front of the class.  While public speaking is a skill that can benefit students in the real world, the opportunity to share private writing in a safe environment with their peers is powerful. \n\nThe use of the Audio-Technic ATR 288W wireless microphone will greatly enhance student performance, as well as the Rocketfish Wireless Bookshelf Speakers, giving an increased sense of confidence as the students use them to share their personal poetry.  In order to reach the intended audience of peers in a classroom, the wireless microphone will allow students the chance to practice their public speaking skills, as well as share their personal writing without the added pressure of voice projection.  The microphone system will also be used to record their performance and create an audio podcast which will allow the students the chance to hear their performance and determine areas that can be improved. \n\nJust imagine that you are back in middle school.  You have been asked to write a piece of work that you are excited about.  It might be the first time you've ever succeeded in writing anything.  You want to share it with your class, but have not had any public speaking opportunities.  Now, imagine how powerful it would be to share your work and hear your voice repeating your performance.  That is the opportunity I want to offer my students! "

","Remember when you were five or six and all you wanted to do was be big and do big kid things? Well the kindergartners I teach want to have the chance to read chapter books. I spent some time with my kids to select some books. They are so excited! \n\nThe 22 kindergartners I teach are remarkable. We've only been together for a little more than a month and during that time we've gotten to know each other well. We've been studying who we are as a community of learners, thinkers, and builders. During our learning, they have shared with me their amazing sense of humor, compassion and understanding with one another, and have expressed their desire to be great writers and readers. The school I teach at serves a diverse population of children from kindergarten to grade five -- local kids, as well as refugee and immigrant families. The challenge with my group of kids is keeping up with their curiosity. I'm doing my best to teach and learn alongside my kids and I'm hoping that you can help. \n\nWe spent some time together going through websites and looking at the kinds of books that they're interested in reading. I am amazed at how much attention they've paid to the older kids at our school and the kinds of books that they are reading. The books I'm requesting to purchase are the books my kids have chosen. \n\nI plan on using these books during read aloud time and to lend to parents to read with their children. While picture books have a very important place and space in our kindergarten classroom, I am listening to my kids and working to create a space that fits their interests and needs and inspires them to become great readers. Chapter books play a critical role in children's literacy. Over the days and maybe weeks of reading a book, children develop particular lines of thought about the characters and stories. Each chapter tests that theory and adds to or changes it. \n \n\nReading is thinking. We can all point to an early memory of reading a book that reached something deep within us. We can recall what that book meant to us and how it changed the way we view things.  I am thrilled by my students' ability to express what they want and why. They know that having a diverse set of literature gives them the opportunity to explore new places and ideas.  "

","Some of my fondest memories as a kid involve curling up in a comfortable reading nook in my elementary school's library. Middle schools often lack such magical little corners. My challenge is to create peaceful, cozy, little reading areas for my own students in a sometimes overcrowded classroom. \n\nMy students live in an urban area of Utah and attend public school in the shadows of a majestic mountain range. Half of my students are in 8th grade and the other half are 9th graders. The students who do not choose Honors or other advanced classes are usually the ones who end up in my regular core class. These classes tend to get quite large, up to 40 students and tend to be some of the most diverse groups in the school. My students come with a wide range of different interests and abilities, which means we are always learning something new about each other. My students are writers, comedians, artists, musicians, athletes, and philosophers.   \n\nThese chairs will be used to create a second reading nook in my classroom. By creating a second reading area, more students can benefit from the class library I have worked so hard to build. Currently, the classroom has one small reading area at the back of the classroom and it is one of the most popular areas of the room. The space holds two armchairs and a small table, which provides a reading space, but is also a place to play games like chess and checkers. The smaller rocking chairs will be used to create an additional space  in a different part of the room that can be utilized by students who wish to have a comfortable place just for reading. This extra space can also be used by students who would like to have a quiet, comfortable place to read during lunch or after school.      \n\nI am a self described ""book nerd"" and spend so much of my time as a Language Arts teacher encouraging my students to discover the joy that words can hold. I feel that presenting literary opportunities for my students is one of the most important things I can do as their English teacher. Building a class library and providing a comfortable reading space can encourage those opportunities, especially for students who may not have such access otherwise. "

My students are constantly challenged with tough decisions.  This book will give my students a new perspective on standing behind their choices and being proud of them. \n\nMy students are from a lower socio-economic background.  They typically come from one parent working class families.  My students work hard but have a limited exposure to world outside of their immediate zip code.  Our school consists of 7th and 8th grade students, outside of a major city. \n\nMy students need 31 copies of Before I Die by Jenny Downham for literature that instills the impact of good decision making.  So often middle school students are faced with challenging choices and they are unprepared. My students desperately need guidance in the area of life choices.  A lot of the population that I serve deal with very adult situations and little to no help in making sound decisions.  Often times my students have to put their needs aside to deal with others in their family.  This book will allow my students to see how circumstances in life can prioritize what is important and that they have a voice, and there are people that are always willing to help. \n\nMy hope is that by reading this book with my students, they will begin to understand what the ""important"" things are in life.  By design, teenagers generally feel alone in making decisions and they lose focus about what is truly important versus what is not.  It is my hope by having this book in my classroom, my students will heed the advice of the main character and begin seeing their own self-worth and begin making good social choices. "

I want them to be able to say abreast current topics while exploring the  various genres in the wonderful world of reading. \n\nI teach two classes of amazing third grade students in a Title 1 school, in south Louisiana.  Many of my students do not have books at home, nor do they have others who will take them to the library. Many do not have parents who are readers.  School is the only source of reading materials for many students. They get so excited about reading materials we have in our classroom. I know they would love to have current magazines that arrive on a regular basis to enhance their learning.  \n\nIn my classroom, we read and write a lot.  Envision students on the floor nestled on rugs with a partners or reading independently. You may also see kids huddled up at desks or sitting in corners as they read. Periodically, they pause to discuss what they are reading,  comment on the illustrations, or take notes on a graphic organizer. Scholastic Storyworks will offer my students another reading source to enjoy while broadening their reading pallets with the various genres and activities offered by Storyworks. It will also give them reading materials to take home to continue to enjoy and share with siblings.  \n\nYour donation will allow my students to enjoy these wonderful magazines and share them with brothers and sisters who may never otherwise get access to such quality reading materials.

They love running around and playing inside and outside the classroom like most children their age. Since movement is so important for five year olds I try to get my kindergarten students moving around in the classroom as much as possible.

I have truly been blessed and touched by each student in my kindergarten class.  \n\nThe outdoor and indoor fine motor toys (balls, jumprope, etc) will help my students with their fine motor skills and will help them by also being active at the same time! In kindergarten, fine motor skills and being actively engaged is VERY important. The students start kindergarten not knowing how to throw a ball, catch a ball, or even jump. These resources will help the students develop in SO many ways physically and mentally. These resources will help them not only in kindergarten but will set a life long foundation for these kindergarten students.   \n\nThis project will impact my kindergarten students in so many ways!! Please, please, please help!! The students will be able to play with toys they have never even had access to before. Something as simple as playing with a  ball can help a student develop lifelong fine motor skills that will help them when cutting, writing, and even reading! The project will impact the students for the rest of their lives!  "

The ELMO slate allows the students to take more of an active part in the learning process because they can more easily participate in lessons.  \n\nMy students are smart and determined but come from a low socioeconomic area. Thus, they are not given the same opportunities as students in other districts. Many do not have access to technology at home therefore it is important to give them this opportunity in the classroom. Many do not get the same academic challenges at home as other students. As a teacher, it is my job to find new and interesting ways to keep them engaged and excited about learning.  \n\nAs mentioned earlier my students have many things on their minds; they may be young but they have experienced a lot. They need new and interactive ways to get involved in learning. The tablet provides them opportunities to show their work. It also allows me to interact with more than just the first row, with students while I am teaching a new concept. My students need this additional attention from me during school. The tablet gets me out with the students while I am showing them how to break a word into syllables or how to add three digit numbers with regrouping. Another great aspect of the tablet is that I can set it in front of a student and allow him/her to do an example or show me how they found an answer. Students love the opportunity to be the ""teacher"" and it will allow me to give more students this opportunity on a more regular basis. The tablet will bring my teaching to a new level.  \n\nThe tablet is an amazing tool for any classroom because it allows me to move about and leave the front of the class while teaching. I went to a great teaching presentation where the presenter said that teachers have to ""get out there and teach with the students."" Many teachers are nervous to move around the classroom or just cannot do it because they need to be able to write and point to items. The tablet is a tool that will allow me to do just that in my classroom today and in the future. "

The only physical education equipment my students have are handballs.  There is only so much handball they can play before they need a new activity.  They need stuff to help them develop their motor skills. \n\nAlthough my students come from truly difficult backgrounds, they are some of the most deserving children in the whole world.  They experience so much drama at home due to high poverty, divorce, and various other family problems.  School is their happy place where they can just be kids.  Many of my students are gifted academically and have yet to have the opportunity to discover if they are gifted athletes. \n\nDue to time constraints and the need to prepare students for the tests, physical education has become a neglected subject.  Students who don't get any exercise at home due to the desire to play with technology aren't getting any exercise at school either.  I want to help solve this problem by encouraging my students to develop a love for physical education.\n\nI am requesting materials to teach softball. My school lacks these materials, making it very difficult to teach the skills needed to teach this game. I will start by using the sticky balls and special rackets to teach overhand and underhand throwing.  My students will take these skills to the baseball field.  At the softball field, I will teach my students how to use their new skills to play softball.  They will have the opportunity to use the balls, gloves, bats, and bases to play a game.  \n\n\n \n\nMy project will help encourage my students to learn about the most valuable thing in the world: their health.  Hopefully, learning about their health will get them off the couch and develop important lifestyle skills that they will keep with them forever. "

It is my job to catch them up so that they can not only graduate high school with a diploma, but lead fulfilling lives. However, my school lacks the resources to provide class sets of books at their current level.  \n\nI teach on a Native American reservation in New Mexico. Ninety-nine percent of my students are Native American. The high school is small; it has about 350-400 students. The students in my class (Reading Intervention) need a lot of support in reading. Most enter my class so frustrated with their lack of success and the difficulty of reading that they proclaim to hate it. However, when given good books, at an appropriate level, one that challenges them, but not to the point of frustration, they get excited and complain when we have to stop reading for the day. My students desperately need more books like this; books they can get excited about. \n\nI vividly remember reading Holes. The book is at an appropriate level for my students (who on average read at anywhere from a second grade to a sixth grade level). However, the structure of the story and the message it contains is thought-provoking. Even though my students read at a low level, they are capable of advanced thinking; so this book is a perfect match. Having a class set will allow me to teach the book and the concepts it includes. Right now we do not have enough books for the students to have copies in class, let alone to take home. All reading must be done in the class. \n\nIf these students are going to have a chance to succeed in whatever they choose, they must be able to read. Having enough copies of a book is a prerequisite to teaching it. I want these students to be able to read at their grade level, but right now they are behind and we must help them grown step-by-step. This is a crucial step. "

The best strategy I have used is to provide a wide variety of books from different genres, and then confer with each reader on finding just the right books to enjoy! Reading frequently makes significantly better readers. If they enjoy what they are reading, we've got them hooked!    This list of books is exciting because it was chosen in response to my students' most popular requests for books: non-fiction topics, notable authors, books that appeal to both boys and girls, sport topics, biographies and fiction books! There is something for everyone in this bunch of books. \n\nYour kind donation will mean the difference in a happy bunch of readers this August and the ability to offer a classroom library that is updated and exciting for second graders!  Collecting one book at a time is not the best way to get them going...a big box of books will do the trick!

Our school is a Title 1 school where most students come from low-income homes.

Students are engaged and take great responsibility with using the iPads. I have enjoyed learning how to use the iPads and students assist me with understanding more. With our world becoming more technology oriented, the exposure of using iPads will enable my students to achieve more throughout their academic careers. I have requested 20 ear buds for the iPads. Having these will enable students to hear the the readers that have sound without interrupting other students who are also reading. \n\nI believe that having access to multiple tools can only encourage academic success within our classrooms.

I love to make Science and all subjects interesting and fun.  Research shows that ""hands-on"" learning is the best avenue for student learning. Students in a hands-on science program will remember the material better, feel a sense of accomplishment when the task is completed, and be able to transfer that experience easier to other learning situations. Likewise, students who have learning difficulties are more likely to be on task in a hands-on classroom because they are part of the learning process and not just reading about it in a book or watching a video. Research also supports teaching that appeals to a variety of learning styles. When teachers are able access more than one method of learning, students have a better chance of remembering what was taught.\n\nOur Title One school is very low on funds for these type of projects, but our students really deserve to have every opportunity to learn that is out there.  Of the 14 students in my class 9 (64.3%) qualify for ""Free Lunch.""  This number is typical for our entire school and the other two classes that I will share these materials with.  Many teachers here at Lone Oak buy the supplimental supplies needed for such hands-on activities out of their own pocket.  \n\nI will be sharing all of these materials with all students in fifth grade (47 total)  These materials will be reusable for several years to come so many more students will benefit from this gift as well.\n\nThere are four different science kits included in this proposal, but any one or two would be a great start and a dream come true!  These are all kits that address the South Carolina standards we teach and they'll go a long way to making these concepts REAL for our students who have such a hard time simply looking at pictures in books or watching a video.  The kits will be one more way for us to make Science a real and more rewarding subject.\n\nThank you!  "

In 2013, students are using IPads, computers, tablets, and a multitude of other technologically advanced equipment to aid them in their quest to become lifelong readers and learners! \n\nMy students live in the largest city in CT - living well below what the government considers poverty level.  This means they do not have access to the latest technological devices, such as computers, tablets, or IPads.  Parents work at jobs that are available to them - and that means any where and at all different hours!  These jobs pay enough for the basics and that's about all.   \n\nThese parents are just glad that they are able to feed, clothe and put a roof over the heads of their family members.  My students come to school from a variety of backgrounds and situations. Some speak very little English. Others may have a learning disability. Some went to preschool and others did not.  But they all come to school wanting to learn and be successful. \n\nI, like every teacher, want my students to become good readers and thinkers that will one day graduate from high school and go on to college. In this day and age, that is not always an easy task.  Each year, there is a varied level of learning experiences that each student brings when they walk into the classroom each and every day.  So, it is up to me to make sure that each and every one of my students is provided instruction that is appropriately leveled and meets  the needs for each individual. So how can I differentiate instruction for all my students? It seems that the Hot Dots program has just the answer. This program uses an electronic pen that students use to choose answers to a variety of questions or prompts - and it provides instant feedback to the student.  These pens are used with special cards that cover phonics, reading, even letter sounds. This program is used during center time - students  would use the program independently while I work with small groups of students. \n\nThis generation of children seem to be driven by technology and gadgets that make learning fun. I believe that the Hot Dots program would be an exciting addition to our first grade classroom. With the variety of programs, I can provide my students with differentiated instruction that would help them in the skills that they are weakest. It would even be beneficial for the student that may not be quite ready to begin reading but needs letter recognition and sounds reinforcement.  "

The only way to win students over to reading is to show them that it can be fun and interesting.  Books like the ones I've chosen are selected specifically for reluctant teen readers.  Once they are reading, they may not even realize how much they are learning. \n\nReading is vital to learning.  Students who don't enjoy and engage in reading for fun rarely make it past high school to college.  Developing the love of reading now may seem like a nice benefit, but it is the key to success in the future. "

For the first time in our school's history, we will be offering an AP Science course in order to prepare our students for the rigor of college course work. \n\nMy students are inquisitive, budding scientists and activists taking part in an Advanced Placement (AP) Environmental Science course. Our school is a Title I public high school in New York, and serves students from a range of backgrounds. This four-year, college-preparatory school strives to provide all of our students with the skills and knowledge necessary to succeed both in college and in life. As part of the Outward Bound Expeditionary Learning Schools network, we strive to make fieldwork a central component of our curriculum. By providing students with the appropriate tools and technology to conduct their fieldwork, we are able to show our students that they can be contributing members of our society. Students in this AP Environmental Science course are the highest achieving science students in our school and are preparing for the challenges of college.  This course will provide them with the opportunity to experience the rigors of a college-level curriculum. \n\nThe AP Environmental Science review books that we are requesting will provide my students with an important tool as they study for the culminating AP Environmental Science Exam.  This exam is administered by the CollegeBoard.  Successful completion of the exam allows colleges to grant college-level course credit to students for the work that they completed in their high school AP course.  By ensuring that students have this invaluable resource as they prepare for this crucial exam, you will be giving them one of the tools they need to succeed.\nAdditionally, the AP Environmental Science Lab Manual that we are requesting will allow my students to meet the rigorous lab and fieldwork requirements of the AP Environmental Science curriculum.  This lab manual will serve as a guide as we complete a range of lab and field work.  These lab and field experiences are particularly instructive in preparing students for the AP exam. \n\nStudents from my school's neighborhood and my students' social-economic background rarely have the opportunity to take AP level courses.  By supporting this project, you will be giving my students a valuable resource for a class that will truly prepare them for college.  The experiences that students will have in this class will allow them to be more competitive with peers from schools across the nation as they apply for college and enter college. "

Despite the environmental disadvantages, our learners continue to strive to excel using the resources available.  My hope is that this added resource will allow the students added ownership of their learning. \n\n     Our school population is 98% socioeconomically underprivileged and 58% English language learners.  Although our campus has recently been modernized, much of our equipment and hardware have either been stolen or vandalized.  Our students are able to work around whatever is missing, bent, or frayed in order to accomplish their tasks.  We are a community of determined, goal-driven learners who, in spite of our circumstances, are able to keep up academically with our middle-school counterparts in more affluent areas. \n\n     One of the areas in which we count ourselves fortunate is in technology.  We have a computer lab that we are able to use at least once a week and an iPad cart which we rotate among grade levels.  The one thing we do not all have, however, is access to portable storage.  Students have to share computer stations, and more often than not, students, usually unintentionally, inadvertently change or delete files which belong to other students.\n     In the past, I have used personally purchased flash drives for student use.  However, it takes up precious instructional minutes to save 36-40 files on five or six flash drives.  By having their own flash drives, students can quickly, effectively, securely, and efficiently save and access their files without having to wait for the previous person.  They will, in essence, have more control of their time and file management. \n\n     By having their own flash drives on which to store and manage their files, students will have the opportunity to take command of their learning.  They will strengthen their management and organization skills, and will be provided with resources to store valuable data.  \n   The students will keep the flash drives at the end of the school year, thus providing them with a digital portfolio of their academic growths and improvements for the rest of their academic years.

The Revolutionary War was a  clean, fast war?\n\nOur disdain for history is palpable and my students on Chicago Southside have inherited this trait from us. So, every year I work to  bring them kicking and screaming into a world where history lives and breathes and where there are no easy answers and very few clean heroes, a world that's more human than Hollywood.  \n\n\nThis is a history closer to The Young and the Restless than Veggitales. This is the history that is hotly debated in universities and the history that is the basis for one steamy tell-all after another. This is a history with a deeper shade of humanity. Lincoln is a martyr, a user, a saint and a depressive all in one man.  Helen Keller is a living miracle and a socialist separatist.  Slavery does not end until well after the Civil War. The forming of our country is done amid blows and beatings in the congress. Lynching continues into the mid 1980?s.  I work to show them how their poverty stricken neighborhood on Chicago's Southside is more like the poor white farmers near the turn of the century than rap videos.\n\n\nHowever, while I'm scraping and tugging, my present Social Studies curriculum mocks me with its one-dimensionality.

I love to teach new topics, which is great, because my students love to learn and discuss all the new things they are taught in class. Fortunately, for the students, they attend a Title 1 School that is located in the inner city of Chicago. This means all of my students qualify and receive free breakfast and lunch. \n\nI am asking for simple but very essential materials for my first grade classroom. My students are in need of a phonemic awareness program on Cd to help them follow the step-by-step lessons to build phonemic awareness. This is a ready to use program and it has enough materials for up to 8 children to use at a time. I am asking for books on Cd so they can listen to a story after they have completed their work. I am also asking for the simple necessities to create an art center in our room. We are in need of glue, crayons, markers, paper and craft tape. Art supplies should be a staple in every first grade classroom in America. I plan to divide the art material between the reading and art center. Therefore, if a student cannot write sentences he could draw his point on the paper.  \n\nAny donation made to this project would make better readers, artist and thinkers. By helping my students learn through art you are helping me create a safe haven classroom. This project may seem very small but it will change many students lives "

Most have families who don't speak English as their first language. School is sometimes the only safe place they have. Here, they aren't judged by how much their parents make or what they don't have because everyone is on the same page. Many only get to interact with computers at school, and even more so, are statistically at lower levels as a result of their economic status. \n\nAn iPad is a hands on way for kids to interact with their learning. Oftentimes, we make letters in the air or on our desk with our finger to practice - how cool would it be for the kids to do it on a computer that interacts with them.

Even more exciting the kids are working with a piece of technology that is getting them ready for what it is like in the real world.  \n\nMany special ed classrooms are already getting these, but due to cost, it is unfeasible to put them in every classroom. Maybe you have an iPad or iPhone, and you can't put it down. Imagine how much our kids would do the same.

My students would like an opportunity to build their reading and writing skills through the use of tablets that will enhance instruction and learning. \n\nMy students represent the 4th and 5th graders at an Oregon charter school. Here, they have created their own microcosm of the greater society and are working diligently to hone their skills in literacy and other content areas to prepare for careers they are already experiencing. They write and enforce the laws, own and operate their own business ventures and government agencies, and manage their own bank accounts - even the kindergarteners!  \n\nWith these tablets, I will be able to address the needs of students who do not process reading and writing instruction through traditional means. With a high population of students receiving special education services, the need for adaptive technology such as these tablets is greater than ever. The availability of educational apps will support students who need additional time, who need alternate presentations of materials, and who may have sensory processing difficulties that prevent them from participating fully in large group activities. It will provide for these students a means to feel more connected to the classroom, while at the same time providing them with critical literacy and technology skills that may not otherwise be met. \n\nHaving these tablets in the classroom will help me to better meet the needs of some of the more disadvantaged students in the classroom. It will allow me to add elements of fun and engaging material to all students in the 4th/5tth grade literacy classroom and provide everyone an equal opportunity to access materials that they may not otherwise have the chance to do.

They will also be able to achieve personal goals like going to college and buying a house. \n\nI teach ninety 3rd through 5th grade students and most speak English as a second language in an inner city, Title 1 school. My students come from homes with hard working parents putting in extra hours at work, leaving them with very little time to spend with their children. Because of their busy schedules and low incomes, these parents are not able to provide their children with many hands on experiences outside of their own homes. Access to technology and advanced learning are non-existent. They need these opportunities to level the playing field with other students. \n\nStudents learn early in life that many decisions will impact what happens to them. This is especially true in the financial world. Students who learn early on how to manage their money, make smart financial decisions, and learn about finacial literacy are apt to have better opportunities to make something of themselves. A laptop would help them with giving them access to a variety of programs where they could practice existing skills and learn new ones regarding financial literacy and money management. They would also be able to connect to online sources that will add to their growing resources. This will put them on the road to being great future consumers for our country and for achieving their personal goals. \n\nIt is great that donors such as CreditReport.com are giving these special opportunities to students who would otherwise not have a chance to develop their financial literacy skills. In a time where governments and districts are losing money, now is the time to help our students learn new skills to manage finances and to have a better future.

They need to build their critical thinking and communication skills, and they've chosen to do that by taking Advanced Placement classes. \n\nUnfortunately, our school does not have the textbooks necessary for this course. I've had to piece together curriculum from an older literature anthology and hundreds of photocopies gleaned from a wide variety of sources. It's piecemeal, at best, and my students deserve better. They deserve a textbook, They Say/I Say, that gives them a complete overview of the requirements of this class, one they can use as a resource as they broaden their knowledge and start to see a wider world. I already have some copies of the book, and your donation will help provide this resource to all of my students. \n\nMy students will use this textbook. They will value this gift as a door into a universe waiting for their exploration. Your contribution will directly contribute to the success of my students and their eventual contributions to society. "

My students work hard and have goals and dreams of obtaining jobs and being productive members of society when they graduate, but they need opportunities to learn vocational skills. \n\nMy class is comprised of an exceptional group of high school students with severe disabilities including intellectual and developmental delays. These are some of the most unique, charming, and inspirational people you could hope to meet. They are excited to attend school every day, in order to interact with peers, learn new skills and share what they've accomplished with anyone who will listen. Our school is a charter school that is focused on providing meaningful experiences for all students. In particular, my program is focused on teaching students real-life skills that they can use after high school- whether that be working at an integrated job site, attending an adult day program, or completing activities under family direction.  \n\nMy students need supplies such as six sprayer bottles, two swivel mops with refills and three PikStik aluminum Reacher with magnetic tip plus six varied carts, for learning how to complete vocational tasks in the classroom and to help do their part to keep the school and our environment clean. My students take pride in all the things they accomplish at school, but are most excited when they have a finished product to show others. Participating in vocational experiences allow students with disabilities to work on a vast array of skills, while doing something purposeful for their classroom and community. Our students are guided by self-determination and are encouraged to experience as much as possible during the time we have them in school. \n\nProviding multiple options of vocational tasks allows students to try different things in a safe environment, build skills in cooperation and working with others, and find out what they enjoy doing. The vocational activities that will be offered and supported with these supplies are: recycling, campus maintenance, making deliveries on campus, sweeping, mopping, cleaning. Students will be able to independently choose the tasks that they enjoy doing, and learn how to do activities that will improve their self confidence and vocational skills. \n\nHaving a purpose in life is what drives us all to become better people. My students are eager to do something meaningful to show that they are capable and to help serve a purpose in their community. Your donations will help an entire class of students achieve their dreams. "

About 90% of them are on free or reduced price lunch, which indicates a level of financial need that could impact their participation in a class trips, like the one we are planning. Through donations and fundraising, we are hoping many students are going to be able to fund their trips. However, some students will not be able to fund even a small portion of their trips.

You will provide the opportunity for them to view St. Louis from the top of the Gateway Arch, explore the famous St. Louis Zoo, tour the City Museum, and experience the St. Louis Science Center. These scholarships will also fund travel, lodging, and food expenses. Scholarship recipients will be chosen through a competitive application process judged by community leaders. \n\nYou can make a difference in the lives of these students by allowing them an opportunity to experience things they may not otherwise be able to see and do.

The students are on the cutting edge of technology for the future.  With the use of a document camera, they will be learning a skill they can take out into the real world where they may become doctors and lawyers.

Students may ""get"" the correct answer, but using the document camera, children can come forth and teach other students their learning strategies. \n\nThe use of a document camera in the classroom could change each student for the better. It would allow students access to a new technology. I know with the use of current technology, the students will be more engaged and willing to share. With that in mind, the learning will follow. Students will benefit by learning how to use the document camera to share their current projects. It would also be used by the teacher to show students different strategies and techniques for problem solving. The document camera would also be used to look more closely at ""The Constitution"" or ""The Declaration of Independence."" It enhances and enlarges the print so that a primary source document can be read more easily. \n\nThis project is important because the students have many different abilities and want to showcase their work. They excel in the areas of presentation and high vocabulary. When students finish a project, they can use the document reader to show other students their project.

Visuals are made and used daily to help them process and understand academics as well as aid in communication in the classroom and in their home. \n\nWe have ten students who have moderate to severe disabilities ranging from autism, to speech impairments, intellectual disabilities and visual impairments.  Most of the students in our class are also economically disadvantaged and do not have access to additional resources outside of the classroom. Many times our students come to our classroom without the ability to self-regulate their behavior or communicate their basic wants and needs.  Visual picture schedules are used to assist students in transitioning between activities as well as a picture exchange system to aid in communication. Visuals are paired with literacy to assist in engaging the students in literacy as well as add additional structure to classroom activities. A Picture Exchange System (PECS) is also used with non-verbal students who need communication systems. \n\nThe students in our classroom need visuals to encourage communication, self regulation and to assist in understanding pre-literacy and other pre-academic concepts. Our campus laminator is old and is often broken which prevents us from creating new materials to help our students with modifications to curriculum and new communication boards.  A working laminator is essential in teaching our students effectively.  Without a laminator, materials must be recreated daily.  With a laminator, our visuals will be preserved and we can use them throughout the school year.  These materials are used constantly throughout the day. \n\nIf our class gets a working laminator, we will be able to create visual picture schedules, visual communication boards and positive behavior interventions to assist students in self-regulating their behavior.  Visuals will be able to be used with books read daily in class, modifications to pre-kindergarten and kindergarten curriculum and song boards to accommodate for our three year old children who have disabilities.

His father is a Patriot while his mother is a Loyalist.  This raises the topic of Loyalist versus Patriot.  In class the students would research the beliefs of Loyalists and Patriots and then break into groups to create word collages of each side.

When ready, we'd like to perform the play for our school!   \n\nThis project is important because these scripts will provide the catalyst to analyze literature apart from an English class setting, will allow us to creatively dream about the production of this play, and with the right practice, our Theater I/II students can actually produce a student-led and student-created work of theatrical importance.

Many come from lower income families, and the visuals help to expand their essential core knowledge, which helps them connect to new subjects. \n\nI am moving from a shared classroom to an office space which I will convert to a classroom.  I have been using an image projector in my shared classroom and it lights up the room with curiosity, a change in mode of teaching, and great variety in material I am able to show to the students.  It allows me to project photographs, text books, worksheets, art, drawings and images not possible with a computer or an overhead projector.  I am also able to sketch, and write on the projected page, and create while the students watch. \n\nI will begin the 2012-2013 school year in an office space which I will be responsible for converting into an exciting, vibrant classroom.  The projector requested will be a terrific help in the transformation.  Imagine walking into the dark classroom to begin English class, with nothing but looming image of the dark and mysterious face of Edgar Allen Poe projected above a picture of a razor sharp blade hanging above a victim's neck.

This should never happen to any student eagerly wanting to learn. Being able to turn any flat surface into an interactive board will create an amazing and fun learning environment for my students.  \n\nMy students are fourth and fifth graders learning to speak, read, and write in English. They are learning to apply the academic language they acquire to all content areas including math and science. Not only do my students need to learn to read, but they also must learn the academic language of all content areas to be successful in school.   \n\nMy students learn best when they are actively participating. An interactive board will provide the active participation my students need. Using technology as a means of providing my students with the ability to interact with the content will improve their understanding and their learning in all areas of academic language.   \n\nSupporting this project will increase my students' love for learning. Having a portable interactive now!Board and a Jr. Wand will provide the opportunity I need to create engaging and meaningful lessons for my students.   "

Several students come from families who either don't speak English at home and can't help them with their reading or work long hours and don't have the time to read with their children even though they want to. My kids love books and one of their favorite parts of the day is when I read aloud to them. \n\nThese iPod shuffles will be used in a listening center along with the books and cds that were previously generously donated through Donors Choose. Listening to fluent reading is essential to a child's reading development.  I want to provide lots of opportunities for my students to hear accurate reading with expression and using these iPods will be one way of accomplishing this. It is especially important to offer this for my students who don't have these opportunities at home. The use of this technology will also be extremely motivating for all my students. My struggling readers will also greatly benefit from the use of the iPods and books on cd because they can read along and listen to books that they may not be able to read independently. \n\nThese iPod shuffles will be such a wonderful addition to our class! Thank you so much for your support of our classroom and public education. We really appreciate your generosity and can't wait to listen to our books on the iPods! "

With today's  budget restrictions, it has become increasingly difficult to provide technological tools for our students to use in their learning.  Much of the technology we currently have is unable to keep up with the changes in computer technology.  The Common Core Standards for middle school students state that they must ""use technology, including the Internet, to produce and publish writing and present the relationships between information and ideas efficiently as well as to interact and collaborate with others.""  This set of Chromebooks will allow access to the Internet for research and collaboration, as well as project creation. \n\nUsing these laptops, our students will be able to conduct research using vast Internet resources and share this research with each other as they collaborate on projects.  They will learn to use good judgment as they navigate sites on the Internet, and they will learn how to responsibly use the resources and information they discover.  Students will use Google Docs in order to create written pieces and share them with classmates and teachers for collaboration.  Students will also learn to use many other web-based tools available to them for product creation and collaboration, creating visual representations to demonstrate their understanding.  Students will have the opportunity to use their tremendous creativity in order to create digital projects.  Student excitement and engagement is visible in a classroom when they are interacting with each other and the amazing resources that are available to them using today's Internet. \n\nThe students of today will be the problem-solvers of tomorrow.  We must give them the tools they need in order to be independent learners and innovators.  Our world has become increasingly digitally-based.

These are the challenges my students face every day. \n\nI work with students in third through fifth grade at an inclusive elementary school.   The children I help have varying needs and abilities.  Some students struggle to speak clearly and need help so their teachers and friends understand them.   This is what most people think of when they think of a ""speech teacher"", but I also teach children how to navigate the often tricky social part of life.  This can be how to ""read"" body language and facial expressions, understanding sarcasm and figurative language, and seeing a situation from another' perspective.  The students I work with who have ASD (autism spectrum disorder) are learning to communicate so that someday they can be independent, functioning members of the community.  Other students I assist may struggle to organize their thoughts and ideas into a cohesive narrative.  For these children their school work often does not reflect their true ability. \n\nVisual are very powerful for children with communication difficulties.  With a simple to use video recorder, my students can watch and listen to their articulation, leading to improved self-monitoring.   Students can act out social scenarios showing the right and the wrong way to act.  Students with autism learning to follow a sequenced routine can watch a video of themselves or someone else performing that same task before they complete the task.  These are but a few ways this technology can help my current and future students improve communication and social independence. \n\nMy students love to use technology.   A chance to use the computer in speech and language is a huge treat.   Imagine their delight to star in and share videos of what we have worked on in speech.

They are ages 11-14, and have severe disabilities which make it difficult to interact with their peers. Most of my students have severely low self-esteem due to an awareness of their disability and feelings of inadequacy. Like most teens their age, my students encounter bullies every day. However, they are not prepared to handle these situations, and often make poor choices, including cursing or trying to fight the other person. Standing up to a bully seems like an impossible task to any of my students, as they become overwhelmed quickly and lose control of their actions. \n\nThe resources I am requesting are picture books that are targeted towards my students' average reading level, which is at about an average of the first grade.

Most of my students come from high-socioeconomic backgrounds where at least one of their parents stays home. Now, you might be thinking, why then do I need help getting classroom books? Even though most of my students come from a high-socioeconomic background and parents are always doing their part by making donations and volunteering their time, parents can only do so much. We are not a Title I school and, therefore, my school often does not get enough funding for teachers to purchase all the materials that we need. My classroom library does not hold very many books and, when we go our school library, often times the books my students want to read are checked out by the older students for months and at a time. My students love to read and it is my job to have books that they want to read on hand. I want my students to be able to come into my classroom and immediately be able to find up to ten books that they want to read! I want them to continue to love reading! \n\nIf I get all the books that I have requested, I will immediately catalog them and put them into our classroom library. Once they are in our library, students will be able to check them out or put them in their book bins. Students can have up to 5 books in their book bin at a time. They use these book bins during Daily 5, where they are given opportunities to reading independently or read their books with a partner. Along with that, whenever we have a free moment throughout the day or a student finishes early, they are to get out a book of their choice and read. By doing this, my students will learn that I value reading and that I love reading. I want them to learn to value reading and to love it as well. I want them to learn that they are readers no matter what reading level they are on. If I can teach them those three things then I have succeeded as a teacher because being able to read and love reading will help them accomplish anything they put their minds to! \n\nIn my classroom choosing not to read is not an option. In fact, it is never even discussed! It is hard, though, to make sure every student has books that they want to read when I don't have enough books or enough variety of books in my classroom. By donating to this project, the donors will allow me to have books in the classroom that I have selected based on student reading interest surveys and a book wish list in my classroom.

The room is oddly shaped and a moveable whiteboard would really help.   ,"In our overcrowded school, the music room isn't in a traditional classroom with multiple white boards in strategic places.  We are in an oddly shaped community room with one white board at the end of a narrow section of the room.  A movable white board would really help us. \n\nMy students are energetic first through fourth graders who love their music class!  Our school serves a variety of socioeconomic levels, but the district as a whole serves many students who are on reduced or free lunches.  Funding for ""extras"" must come from the PTA or outside sources such as donorschoose and Chevron.  Our music program has endured severe cuts and receives little to no funding for materials due to the economy and increased pressure on schools to perform better on standardized tests. \n\nA movable white board will help us save precious minutes for instruction.  Currently, I see students for 50 minutes per week and some of that time is used moving students from chairs to sitting on the floor in front of the white board that is too far away for them to see from the chairs.  The section of the room that has the white board is too narrow to fit enough chairs without blocking the doorway.  So, sometimes we sit in the chairs, but if I want to demonstrate something on the board, we have to move everyone to the carpet, wasting instructional minutes that could be used more efficiently.  A movable white board will allow us to save instructional minutes and can be moved out of the way so that we can play music games in that same space. \n\nA movable white board will go a long way in improving the efficiency of my music classroom.  Students will not be taking precious instructional minutes transitioning to the floor and back. "

Every year some of my stools break. I lost five of them last year. My students work for 90 minutes at a stretch, sitting on ancient, hard, unsafe metal stools. Discomfort makes it difficult to concentrate on artwork. \n\nMy students come from diverse ethnic and cultural backgrounds, but are united in their love for art. Our free public school is a magnet school for the arts. Students must audition in order to be accepted into our program. \n\nMy students are intensely interested in art. They use the artwork they produce in my class for entry into local, regional, and national art competitions, A.P. college credit portfolios, and entry and scholarship portfolios for college. Because we are part of a large inner city school district, my students tend to come from the bottom end of the economic spectrum. The work they produce is important, both for the students' self image, and often, for their future well-being. \n\nThe work my students produce can change their lives for the better; their success in art can open doors for them in real, often unexpected ways. Recognition at this age (high school) can lead to opportunities such as: scholarships, internships, and even acceptance to college. \n\nFor this reason, I want to provide the very best possible environment for my students. I do not want them to have to endure an antiquated, uncomfortable, unsafe working environment. These new stools will allow them to work without distraction, so they can do their very best. \n\nGiving my students a safe, comfortable work environment will enable them to maintain their focus and develop their skills without distraction or discomfort. When a school's equipment is substandard, students sometimes feel that they are only being given the cast-off's, the leftovers. I want my students to know they are worth more than that. I want to give them the best, so they will feel that they are worthy; that they deserve the best. "

With the new implementation of these standards, students will experience more text complexity which should first be modeled by the teacher with these books. The incorporation of more non-fiction texts will also expose the learners to more inquiry-based experiences which will open the door to other instructional approaches like project based learning, in turn creating globally competitive students. It's amazing the difference a book makes and what you can do with it! \n\nThis project is important because it exposes students to the text complexity that is required in the new common core standards whole group before they are sent to face it on their own.

I can not imagine not having unlimited water all day and it breaks my heart that my students are drinking from a community fountain which is not sanitized, is not convenient in location, doesn't provide cold water, and is connected to older pipes.  It takes a long time to quench their thirst when drinking from the fountain, also. \n\nIt would be wonderful if the children had a water cooler to have at their disposal all day, especially after recess and PE.  Your donation which would provide the students with this refillable cooler would be a daily gift to young children as well as an investment in their health--which ultimately would result in better learning!  \nThe next time you are thirsty and reach for a cold glass of water, a cold soda, a cold iced tea...be grateful you are not drinking warm, metallic-tasting water from a less than sanitary fountain.

First grade math has always been fun and hands-on, but the teacher resources I have been reading from Marilyn Burns have really inspired me to challenge my students with word problems.  My students have to draw a picture, write about how they arrived at the answer, and be able to explain their thinking to the rest of the class.  It is so fascinating to watch the little light bulbs above their heads go, ""Ding,"" when they've come to a realization about math!\n\nThe teacher resources from Marilyn Burns use a variety of different books to introduce and assess student understanding of math concepts ranging from number sense and place value to money and geometry.  I am so excited that EAI Education has teamed up with Marilyn Burns to create a Math & Literature Classroom Set of books not only for First Graders, but also for Second and Third Graders! Even though I teach first grade, the books in the second and third grade set can be used with first grade math lessons as well.\n\nMath and Language Arts can now be integrated, and our class can study specific books more in depth.  Not only will these books be a wonderful addition to my classroom library, but they are a great way to introduce and assess a specific math concept.  The students will enjoy reading these books over and over again!\n\nThank you for giving me the tools to link Math and Language Arts so easily!  I am definitely sharing these books with other first grade teachers at the school!\n\n"

When weak students fail classes, they have more classes to pass than stronger students.  Dropouts result.  We help students that are on the verge of dropping out by letting them earn the credits in courses they failed.  This helps keep students in school.  Even though they aren't superb students, it's better they spend two more years in school in a structured environment, then wandering the streets. \n\nTeaching math and science today means NOT scribbling on a whiteboard, but preparing concise presentations or flash animations on a computer and displaying them with a LCD projector.  Even with a budget crunch, the projectors were purchased, but no screens.  We use walls and glossy whiteboards, if practical, which they usually aren't. It's rasquache. \n\nWhile teaching math and science, I'm responsible for supporting the tech needs of four classrooms.  With four screens the instructional problem goes away. \n\nProjection screens complete the software, computer and projector set.

High quality literature engages learners and increases interest levels, and my students are accustomed to a literature-rich social studies and reading experience. We have nothing to go with our Civil War unit, and we need your help! \n\nMy students are gifted fourth graders in an inner-city school setting. They learn social studies and reading in my class, and the two subjects are thoroughly blended. What we learn in social studies is the basis of our reading. We learn about topics with activities and projects based on historical fiction and nonfiction that take us through history, United States regions, and the different cultures of the United States. They have loved reading everything at their disposal and my results have dramatically increased in social studies since I have completely integrated the two subjects. They are bright, independent, and eager to learn, and are developing a love of literature and history that leaves them asking for more at the end of every unit. \n\nMy students are voracious readers who love a well-written and well-developed character. The two novels I have chosen will provide both  in one, they get to be the main character, choosing which side of the Civil War they want to be on and how that role will play out. In the other, we have a bold character who doesn't always think before he acts, and it quite often gets him into trouble. We have read a book with a similar character already, which will lead to a great compare/contrast. Using the nonfiction books, we will support the history within the historical fiction text, make comparisons, and check for accuracy. The adventure book also leads to great lessons on summarizing, with the nonfiction to use as supporting evidence to further describe their adventures. Lastly, the picture books will provide other sides to the Civil War they don't always think about from different points of view, and help them piece together everything occurring all at once during this time in history. \n\nI have been able to provide such a literature-rich experience to my students this year, and I have no materials with which to teach the Civil War. I want to provide the same experience to my students that I have been able to give them thus far. My students need these materials to take charge of their knowledge, learn effective research skills, compare texts, and use them to tell the story of the Civil War, instead of just learning to recite the facts. Help us to REALLY learn about it! "

This exclamation rings out from the parents of my third grade students.  They want to help their children learn how to read, develop vocabulary, and strengthen their comprehension skills, but lack the materials in order to do so.   \n\nThe students in my classroom are third graders ranging from age 8-10.  The majority of our school is on free lunch.  My students are required to pass the reading portion of the FCAT test in order to go on to fourth grade.  Comprehension is a huge part of the third grade state standards. \n\nIf I were to receive these eight sets of books and binders, I would send them home each month for parents to use as a resource with their students.  I will put assignments with vocabulary, phonics, and comprehension activities in the binders for parents to use.  After reading the 3.1 book, the student will be given the 3.2 book and so on.  This initiative will hopefully challenge both the students and parents to fall in love with reading and increase their fluency, vocabulary, and comprehension. \n\nThis project has significant importance to this generation of students and parents.  In the world we live in, parents do not have the money to afford the resources to help their children be successful in school. Ultimately, if students do not enjoy reading, they will struggle with reading and all the other subjects for the rest of their school career and beyond.  My wish is for all students to be able to read on grade level, and with your help, I know this can be a reality.\nThank you! "

At the same time, students are evaluated for reading to find their ""just right"" reading level and with new Common Core standards they need to read and comprehend informational texts. By providing my students with a non-fiction library that has a variety of choices of books of interest at their level, they will pursue their interests and extend their science explorations by reading.  Some titles from the library include the following: SHELLS, WINGS, WE CAN EAT THE PLANTS, ANIMALS IN WINTER, and FROGS. \n\nMy classroom library is primarily full of fiction titles.  Many are read-aloud books grouped by subject and I have a small collection of leveled readers along with the prescribed curriculum phonics readers which are fiction as well.  By having a leveled non-fiction library, my young students will read and understand a different type of text in a subject they love, science. "

Most of their households include single parents working two jobs. They end up being labeled latch-key kids because their parents are not home to help them. They take care of their siblings or themselves. There is no one to help them to the full extent that they need. They are wonderful students with so much potential. They love learning, but by being in a classroom that looks like a dungeon they don't have a desire to learn. \n\nI want my students to enter the classroom and have learning on their minds. I chose to use colorful furnishings because children love bright and colorful objects because it captures and maintains their interests longer. The 3 bean bags would be put in the library center for independent and/or partner reading. This will enhance their fluency. They can have someone, who may be a stronger reader, to guide and assist them with difficult words if they choose to read with a partner. Reading independently helps them to internalize what they are reading, building their comprehension. The storage unit will be used to store math, literacy, writing, and quiet centers. They will be able to explore and reinforce skills they are learning during whole group instruction. The bins will be used to store the centers.\nThe goal of this project is to open doors of opportunity and to tap into what they truly enjoy doing. Once they figure that out they will enjoy coming to school and more open to learning \n\nBy donating, you hold the power in your hands to change and break the cycle of the academic projection of students from low income areas.

This school not only gives student an opportunity to be successful academically, but also in the arts. My students join conservatories to master their artistic passion, which ranges from various styles of dance, theater, drawing/sculpting, band, choir, circus arts, costume design, photography, and graphic design. \nSince these students tend to focus on their craft, academics aren't always a priority to them. While trying to teach them Algebra, I'm competing with their long hours of rehearsal and their kinesthetic learning styles. \n\nIf I were able to incorporate a document camera into my lessons, students would be more engaged. The document camera would allow me to zoom in on detailed graphs, model effective note-taking skills, display student work, and easily show students how to complete each step of a math problem. Additionally, I could increase instructional minutes by spending less time erasing previous problems on the whiteboard, copying down the new problem, and waiting while every student writes it down before I can erase it again. If a student gets behind, I can give them the paper I just wrote on and move on to the next part of the lesson more efficiently. \n\nThank you for your consideration of donating to my project.

Poverty has ensured these odds, limiting my students from having resources that many schools across the country take for granted. \n\nMost of my students are significantly behind grade level in every subject. For some of them, they are more than 2 grade levels behind in reading and mathematics. They have not received the opportunity to develop the basic skills that will be necessary for them to succeed in middle school. For them, this means that already they are at risk to be high school drop-outs. \n\nMy students are old enough to understand that they have very real obstacles they must overcome every day to be successful - poverty, hunger, homelessness. Every day that my students walk into my school building is a day to be thankful for. However, I want more for them. Together, my students will work to be advocates for their own education and understand that they are important to the world around them. \n\nMany of my students have internalized the idea that they are not intelligent or that their answers will undoubtedly be wrong if they choose to respond. I desire to show my students that mistakes are the first step to understanding, particularly in mathematics, where I myself struggle with anxiety.\n\nWhite boards give my students the opportunity to share their answers with me without being subject to whole class judgment. I can easily check for understanding as I look at their boards. Since my class does not yet have a document camera, it also gives students the opportunity to show their peers their thinking. White boards can also be used for review, literacy centers, and interactive games. \n\nMy students operate under the idea that they are ""world changers."" One way we change our world is by being as ""green"" as possible. White boards are a reusable resource that students can manipulate to tap into their full potential. \n\nWhen I think of my students, I flash back to my own fifth grade self, sitting in a classroom much like my own. Whenever a math question popped up, my heart immediately began to race with fear that I would be called on and that I would offer up the wrong answer in front of my entire class. \n\nThese white boards will be used in dozens of ways in my classroom, but first and foremost they will be used to help my students gain confidence as learners.

They were taken from her cancer in 1951 and were cultured successfully in a lab.  This was the start of cell culture and her family had no idea.  It raises a major issue of racism.  The students will be completing weekly discussions of this book and will complete a research project and presentation on racism in science. The book also touches upon many topics that we cover throughout the year and can be referred to as we learn about them later.  This book was an eye opener and I would love for my students to experience it. \n\nThis book explains so much about how science and research works behind the scene.

Once again, our school will not have a yearbook. However, that doesn't mean we can't collect images of the fun and meaningful times that will transpire this year and organize our own version of a year book. \n\nThe students I teach are labeled ""Special Needs."" We are a Title I high school that doesn't have sport programs, or too many clubs for students to participate in.  The students at our school are typical for their age in most ways. They want to find meaning in their life and in how they spend their time. They want to succeed and live productive lives with jobs they can be proud of. \n Many students I teach live in the projects or commute to school from quite a ways away.  Their stories are not always similar despite facing obstacles that may be. This project will hopefully bring a greater understanding of how images are manipulated, and how they can use that understanding to benefit themselves.  \n\nThe use of images is integral to the learning of many of the young adults I teach, and therefore the understanding of the role, use and manipulation of images is an area that will serve them well. Not everyone is gifted with words, the ability to create and discuss images will help them to comprehend and respect images they come across in the texts they use.\n One specific way we will try to make this happen is in the recreation of  iconic images from history (for example, Washington crossing the Delaware, the swearing in of a President, Khrushchev's U.N. speech, propaganda pieces).  Students will play the roles of the famous individuals in paintings, drawings, carvings, and, of course, photographs.  Previous lessons that I have used based on images have always focused on detail.  Those details (clothing, hair, technology being used) often lead to wonderful questions that access a deeper understanding of the times the image is representing. \n\nStudents love technology and when I can connect that technology to the past students are more focused, generally because they are more interested. Also, as a SPED teacher I work with many visual learners who will benefit by using the materials in correspondence with the curriculum. Positive memories of school may be the norm for the college grad but for my students it isn't always so.

I know there are many apps that are free for math and spelling and would be simple  to manage and the kids would love it. \n\nThe Common Core State Standards are right around the corner.  They state that children need to be ready for life in a technological society.  My students will benefit greatly from having this modern technology in the classroom.  It will enhance their speaking and listening skills which are essential for the new standards.  I can use the iPad, along with my classroom technology, so that all the kids can enjoy it at once. "

The students at my school are very creative and enjoy creating projects and presentations; however, they have difficulties gathering materials  for these projects.  \n\nMost of the materials I am requesting are simple items that will make the students presentation more colorful and interesting.

The other items (pipe cleaners, beads, and styrofoam balls) will be used for a specific project, building cells! Students will at least have access to these few materials as they build their own 3D representation of a cell.  \n\nAcross the board my students will be grateful for these materials. Last time I attempted this project we had several students that could not acquire any materials.

Last year I concentrated on providing basic drawing skills with students in grades K-6. I also arranged and organized museum field trips to the Museum of Modern Art, the Museum for African Art, the Museum of the Moving Image, the Guggenheim, Mobia, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum and more. The students gained a lot of experience by seeing great works of art and this impacted their work in art, literacy, math, and science. \n\nTo prepare students for the upcoming year I have asked donors to provide 6 light boxes and tracing paper in order to expand on their drawing skills and experience. \n\nWriting students need to make revisions in order to improve their writing. Art students can do the same with tracing paper and a light box. The way this is done is to use the tracing paper to trace one of their drawings out of their sketch book and then improve on it by using a light box. Let us say a student would like to create a setting for a character they have created in their sketch book and the sketch of the background was done while visiting a museum. The student can then take the two drawings or more and layer them on top of the light box to trace onto a completely new piece of tracing paper to create a composite. Once the student is satisfied with the composite, the student can then trace the entire drawing onto a quality piece of drawing paper and make decisions on what kind of medium they would like to use. This process enables students to realize that a sketch is really the same as a seed idea in writing. It is just the beginning. \n\nOther ways I plan to use the light boxes and tracing paper are with logo design, animation cells and looking at great works by artists. As we investigate how artists work, students will have the professional tools at their fingertips. \n\nSix light boxes and tracing paper would allow me to set up six workstations for students to experiment with making small changes working in cooperative groups. It is important for them to know that the first round of sketches is not their final piece of artwork but needs to go through several phases before it is considered complete.\n\nThank you so much for choosing Donorschoose.org.

But trying to explain a concept using math manipulatives in my hands to students clear across the room is an even greater challenge. Help us see better with a document camera. \n\nMy class consists of 28 inner city students. They attend a small, urban community school that is currently ""failing"" according to the No Child Left Behind Act. But it's a school where the faculty works effortlessly to enrich the lives of their students.  Being in a rougher area, parents are often uninterested in their child's education and students are frequently unruly. However, the teachers are committed to investing all they have in the lives of their students. This school is nearly 100% free lunch and receives money from Title I. \n\nMy students need a document camera so that ALL of them can see when I use manipulatives, complete worksheets, or try to explain something from a small area. This document camera will allow me to project whatever I am doing onto the smart board next to me for my students to see. When I teach math, it is difficult for all my students to be able to see what exactly I am doing with my manipulatives. Also, when students complete worksheets it is much easier for students to understand the directions when I am able to project the sheet on the board and point as I explain.  I'm excited to get a document camera so that all my students have a chance to understand what I am doing and follow my lead. This technology is the next step in making my teaching more effective. \n\nThis project is important to me because I value my students' education. I have high expectations for them as well as myself. Having a document camera will allow me to be a more effective and efficient teacher while, at the same time, give my students more clarity. I am looking forward to learning new ways to utilize my product. Thank you! "

I asked them for a list of books that they are interested in reading and many of them gave me their wish list. \n\nMy 8th grade students are enthusiastic about reading but not all of my students have access to books that they find interesting to read. Our classroom library may be the only access to books these kids have and I want to make sure that they have the tools they need to succeed.  \n\nMy classroom is a place for students to check out books to read during free time in class and to be able to take home. Most of the books in our library are hand me downs from a teacher who retired. Now we're looking to update our library with interesting books that students will actually want to read. We are requesting 18 different high-interest books from popular series to excite them about reading.\n\nBy donating to this project, you will help transform their classroom library. You will help students continue their love of reading by giving them books that they will actually pick up and read.  "

By incorporating a social justice component in every lesson my students will learn the value of human rights. This will help them understand the people of the Spanish speaking countries through a different point of view, their own. \n\nMy students are scholars from NJ that have a great thirst for knowledge. My scholars are intelligent, hardworking, and outspoken, but their most important characteristic is that they never give up. I admire their dedication to their studies, to their families, and their culture. My students attend the Paulo Freire School where our school mission is to help them strive for knowledge, wisdom, and understanding for the betterment of our society. Our school culture is very strong due to the bonds and relationships the students form with one another and their teachers. I am very proud to say that I am the teacher to such amazing students. \n\nOne of the most important resources that my students need is the Spanish-English dictionary. Through this dictionary my students will be able to not only learn Spanish but they will also be able to learn the art of translating. I want to create an open space for my students to feel comfortable and create my classroom to be their safe space where they are able to freely express themselves. I know that by facilitating the simple needs of my students, by for example having pencils and paper readily available, will allow my students to engage more in our conversations and focus more on learning the beautifully diverse Spanish Language. \n\nThis project is very important to me because I am able to help my students in the simplest way. A folder to organize their papers, a pencil to write with, and paper to write on are all essential items that my students need to be successful in my classroom. "

The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins is just the book students need! \n\nMy students are kids, ages 13-15 who come from diverse incomes, races, and abilities.  These students are typical 8th graders who have started to question the world around them.  They attend a school that nurtures their curiosity, but also makes the engagement of every student a priority. \n\nThe Hunger Games is a book that is set in a post apocalyptic time period, but its plot allows students to question the importance of community, power, selfless acts, and decision-making.  As students plunge into this great tale, they will become a part of the setting of the book by experiencing a survivor-like game that will teach the enduring lesson of teamwork and perseverance.  This novel will be a culmination of all the skills that we have worked on this year, and becomes a chance for students to merge their knowledge with their beliefs. \n\nLiteracy is the key to success. Many students struggle to read, find books that are relevant to their everyday lives, and enjoy the adventures of reading.  The Hunger Games is a book that contains the key ingredients to helping students become lifelong lovers of books.  It is high interest yet challenging, and it causes them to think about the world they live in. This book is one that will be engaging right now and will teach students to become active participants in their world. "

One of the stations is ""Promethean Power"".  At this station, students participate in various activities/educational games.  We target this station to either be a review of what we have recently been learning, a preview of what is coming up or a review for an upcoming assessment.  This activity has been the most popular as students get to play with computers and combine learning with fun activities!   \n\nStudents with learning disabilities need learning in many forms.

It will be a device that they'd really want to use to stimulate their desire to learn. \n\nIn our class my students learn about the importance of reducing carbon footprint as a strategy to apply,and teach more families to live a cleaner, longer, and healthier life. With the use of technology in the classroom, it too will limit the amount of carbon footprint used. \nSince we do not have a lab with few equipment items, students will use the iPad to do virtual labs and manipulate science problems with the incorporation of Math and English concepts too. \n\nThere are applications to support their understanding at various levels, for example I have students ranging from below basic to advanced levels. Students can also use the iPad to reference information that cannot be found in our textbooks. Every student has a different learning modality and requires different means of communication through diagrams, movement, oral, or visual examples to understand science concepts. Students can write and edit on the iPad and share their information with the rest of the classroom. \n\nPlease help my students experience the Science with technology. This is their chance to interact with applications that are available through our curriculum that are also engaging!By supporting my students you will enable my students to get a step ahead, when they've been two steps behind for most of their lives. Through all of their misfortunes and uncertainties they are expected to succeed. Keep me in your thoughts as iReach and Teach my Students science concepts. "

I have been extremely fortunate to have been given the opportunity to teach at an extremely poor Title One school in the City of Chicago. Even though it has become extremely difficult and sometimes frustrating to educate without needed supplies, our students still come to school eager to learn. Our school rarely has extra funding for enriching material and if they do, the funds are used for older students. Many of my students' families will never have additional money to purchase education material. Therefore, I hope to be able to provide a fun and interesting way of learning so my students can succeed in life! \n\nI am asking for ten simple Phillips headphones. My students need these headphones so they can connect them to the tablets we received from Donors Choose. I have thirty Kindergarten students in my classroom so we have to share the tablets  we have. During center time, students love to visit the computer center but the problem is that they love to raise the volume to clearly listen to the letters of the alphabet. However, in doing so my other students become distracted. Therefore I am asking for headphones so students on the computers can listen to the sounds and the other students that are working can continue to work without distractions. I am also asking for alcohol wipes so we can clean the headphones after each use. \n\nThis project is important to me because there is nothing better than seeing a student's face light up after they have learned how to say the sounds of the alphabet by simply listening to the sounds with headphones.

Doing this provides another avenue for gaining students' interest and reaching those students who learn in a different way.  Lately I have been doing less and less of these activities because the computers in our classroom are so old, slow and do not work well.  The newest desktop we have is at least 10 years old.  It's older than my students!  I would like to have an updated computer to continue reinforcing lessons, and for use by individual students who need extra help in specific areas.

Please encourage our students to flourish in the visual and performing arts. Provide them with these typically unused materials for their traditional visual arts classroom! \n\nMy students are Pre-K-8th grade visual artists at an Elementary School in Georgia. \n\n\nIt is necessary to bring fiber techniques and materials to the core curriculum, because the students must be given the tools to achieve excellence in this medium, school and beyond. \n\nMy students need muslin, plastibands, batik wax,and dye to be able to explore the world of Fiber Art.\n-First the students will learn the classic dyeing technique of batik. This is an ancient art form of wax resist on dyed natural fabric. To make a batik, selected areas of a piece cloth are blocked out by brushing or drawing hot wax over them, and the cloth is then dyed. The parts covered in wax resist the dye and remain the original color. This process of waxing and dyeing can be repeated to create more elaborate and colorful designs. After the final dyeing the wax is removed and the cloth is ready for wearing or showing.\n-Students will also be experimenting with the technique of Tie-dyeing. Folding the material into a pattern, and binding it with string or rubber bands accomplishes this technique. Dye is then applied to only parts of the material. The ties prevent the entire material from being dyed. Designs are formed by applying different colors of dyes to different sections of the wet fabric.  \n\n-Fibers challenge students to use creativity at a multi-sensory level. It engages them both physically and mentally throughout the process. Fibers teach students high-level lessons about process, control and chance. Successful experiences in three dimensional medium empower students beyond their artwork/final piece. My students need a fiber  component in their Visual Arts program to make connections across curriculums by creating hands on learning experiences. "

I teach Language Arts and Social studies in a low income,high minority middle school in Central California and am thankful for Donorschoose .org.  for helping make possible what my students and I could only dream of before.\n\nMany of our students come from single parent homes with little or no financial support.  School for many of them is their only chance for success. This is the only place where they can have access to technology that can help them learn.  \n\nEven though my students face these everyday challenges they want to be successful and will work hard with the right motivation.  They are capable and have high energy in an engaging classroom. \n\nThe document camera is one of the easiest technology to integrate in the classroom.  This is a great tool to motivate students by its interactivity.  Student work can be shared and the teacher can give immediate feedback.  Student can use the document camera to share their group projects as well as their individual work.  Students with vision impairments will no longer complain about not being able to see.  I will be able to enlarge workbook pages, invaluable when reading directions teaching and sharing student work.  All students will be able to look over drawings, maps, graphs and charts.  Showing while we are doing is much better than trying to hold something up for them to see.  Most importantly, I will be able to reach my students who are English learners and those who have learning disabilities more effectively.  They will be able to successfully attempt the assignment because the document camera provides an effective filter to the barriers presented by giving oral directions. \n\nThere has never been a time more than now that my students don' need your help. I know without a doubt that my students will benefit immensely from this project.  The possibilities that this project will afford my students are endless. "

In preparation, pickup football games are a daily occurrence on the school playground during required physical activity time. \n\nIn order for the students to properly engage in the game and receive optimal physical activity time, we need a flag football set.

Students come in check the board and share with their team their answers to their math homework.  There is daily vibe of excited discussions around their mathematics and how they arrived at their answers.  \n\nOur school is a unique sixth grade through twelfth grade school.  The school mission is to empower youth to take ownership of their educational experience, to celebrate their diverse community, and to actively participate as a member in a democratic society.  Our math class celebrates their diversity daily by sharing about their different approaches to problem solving.  We understand that together we are smarter than we are alone. \n\nMy students come up with unique, creative and visually engaging solutions to their mathematics every day. They share with their partner and teams their written work on an ongoing basis.  I would like to share with the entire class the variety of solutions with a document camera projected on a screen large enough for everyone in the class to see. This way those who may not have considered an approach will learn from their classmates.  This will also enhance learning through helping the whole class see what quality, creative, well organized work looks like. \n\nThe validation a young person feels when their work is shown as an outstanding example is a powerful motivation to do exceptional work.  The document camera and large screen will allow students to shine and show the class community just how talented they are. "

Given our testing requirements, the entirety of that- along with teachers' own money- is spent on scantrons. There's nothing left over for art supplies, which high school students need as much as younger students do. \n\nOur students are creative and motivated with a wide range of talents and interests. One of our primary objectives as a school is to help them develop as well-rounded individuals and learn that all skills - academic, artistic, athletic, communicative, technological - apply in all areas. We also hope to help them develop a service-minded mentality that leads to a lifetime of community involvement, which is modeled for them when activists and philanthropists like YOU support their classroom endeavors! \n\nOur cardstock will be used for two primary purposes: to first print colorful reward certificates to recognize the achievement of ALL students, and secondly to provide students with adequate and sturdy materials to create collages, storyboards, and the other art-related projects that we endeavor to include in our social science curriculum. These 'crossover' art projects make the material visually appealing to students, engage them in hands-on learning, and further our goal of well-roundedness, while the certificates are a means of inspiring students and letting them know that we've noticed and wish to celebrate their accomplishments, improvements, and contributions.  \n\nA little color goes a long way!  Having vibrant and colorful materials with which to work makes school just look a little more exciting and fun.  Being able to use their art skills in a traditional academic discipline reminds students that their talents are valuable in all settings and that learning crosses all boundaries, literal (classroom walls) and figurative (self-imposed limitations). And, no one is ever too old to delight in recognition of their accomplishments and endeavors!  "

In addition, these books provide a geographic tie in each book.","Our classroom is constantly filled with stories, whether I'm sharing a personal one from my own life or students are telling me something from theirs.  We have comic books, novels, Storia on iPads, magazines and textbooks open all the time.  It's a machine that is always running! \n\nI noticed at the beginning of the year, a majority of my 18 students were interested in reading spooky stories.  Maybe it's because the beginning of they year was already close to Halloween.  It would have been great to share more spooky stories with them other than the R.L. Stine Goosebumps stories that I grew up reading.  The American Chillers stories sound captivating!  And each book provides a state tie, so talking about geography would be a great connection.  I could even see us creating a map of the United States that individuals could use to track their own progress as they ""read across the country"" while enjoying each of Jonathan Rand's stories.  This activity could easily be implemented by the end of the year if this project is funded. \n\nIf these requested materials arrive in my room, I will be able to read with small groups from materials they are truly interested in!  We can bounce ideas off of each other about fictional stories, the spooky genre, and even geographic topics as we read from Jonathan Rand's books together.  My students can even teach me (after reading a book) what makes a great scary story!  It would be nice to have an updated collection of different fiction genres in our classroom library.\n\nDonation to this collection of spooky stories is great because we would receive an entire set of books from one author.  It also makes sense to purchase the entire set since each story is tied directly to a state in the U.S. \n\nI assist young readers in creating connections with materials they read.  I feel that a reader who is not connecting with the materials they are reading is simply going through the motions and not using higher level thinking strategies.  By creating these connections (across the curriculum in the case with this book series, like social studies), I can help students relate to characters better, explain their own thoughts about the story, and assist them to becoming stronger readers.

Did it sound different that you thought it would?  A key part of teaching children to sing and play instruments with good technique is to hear what the music really sounds like.  We need a way to make this happen in my classroom. \n\nI teach music to 500 students in grades K-5 at a Title 1 school in suburban South Carolina. We have a very diverse population of children and I teach regular and special education students.  My students LOVE coming to music class and with 22 classes we try to make every moment count! \n\nThe digital recorder, SD card, and batteries requested in this project will allow both classes and individual students to hear themselves perform.  Our state and national music standards state students should learn to ""Devise criteria for evaluating performances"" and ""Apply music concepts when judging the quality of their performances"".  The recorder would allow them to do this so much more easily.  Students would be able to self-evaluate their own performances in order to improve on them.  We would also be able to make copies of final performances for parents to keep.  We could even use the recordings to pipe music of the children singing and playing instruments in the hallways of the school during parent nights.  How exciting that would be! \n\nWith brain research proving that music is math and music boosts students' scores on tests, it is imperative to support music programs in public education. Even at the elementary school level, a student may be sparked to find their passion. Involved students are successful students.  Your donation to this project will impact thousands of children over the years to come! "

Luckily, some of the other teachers were able to give me some of the furniture they were not using, but I am still in need of appropriate furniture for my classroom.  Every classroom should be set up before the children arrive on the first day of school, but I am still struggling to get my classroom organized and workable for my young students.  I do not have appropriate storage units to contain the materials and supplies in my classroom.    \n\n  It is extremely important to create a clearly organized and highly structured environment for children with autism to effectively educate them.  As in any kindergarten classroom it is important to have all materials stored neatly, with the ability to clearly label each material so that the students can find things easily.    Having appropriate storage units not only keeps the classroom organized, but models for the children that everything has an appropriate placement (i.e. pencils belong with pencils in the writing center, puzzles belong in the puzzles basket in the play center).  Baskets, boxes and bins are necessary to keep the students and teachers in the classroom organized.\n\n  You can help to keep a kindergarten classroom organized and running smoothly. \n"

The funds in our district are extremely limited.  Most of the extra materials that I use in my classroom I have had to purchase on my own.\n\nExposure to literature of all genres is essential in all grades but it takes a different tone in first grade.  Most of the children who come to me are not able to read at all.  We start from there and it almost seems like a miracle, but by the middle of the year, kids are reading all over the place.\n\nThe big book plays an important role in first grade.  It captures the attention of the children with its large illustrations. It is a wonderful tool to use when finding words and patterns in a story because the type is such a nice size.\n\nThe big book is used weekly in my class.  I would like to use it everyday, but without an easel it is quite difficult to use the big book very effectively.  I have the children gather around me.  I hold the book with the text and pictures facing the children with my two hands.  Then I read the book looking down. When it comes time to turn the page, a big problem usually occurs.  Usually one of the children has to come up and help out.  But when they have to help hold the book, then they miss out on getting a good look at the pictures and the words.  \n\nA nice easel would make things so nice for the children and for me.  We could all sit around the story and see everything so clearly.  We could come up to the easel and frame with our hands rhyming words, consonant and vowels, repeated phrases and so much more.  \n\nI have never had an easel that is child size and user friendly.  I was so grateful and excited when I heard about donors choose.  Schools are so fortunate that many people are out there just wanting to make learning more meaningful for the children.  \n\nA new easel in the classroom would have us all shouting, ""Looking and Learning and Loving It...Oh My!!""\n\nThank you so much for giving me the opportunity to apply for this easel. It will be put to good use, I promise.\n\n \n"

This program also allows for positive reinforcement, which I feel can get lost at the high school level. This iPad with a VGA adapter could also be connected to our projector which would make presentations on countries more engaging. With more technology in the classroom, research could be done more frequently and presentations could become a regular in our class. \n\nI feel that my students could benefit from this project.

We do so by providing our students with rigorous curricula, advanced classes, and the opportunity to take college courses as early as the 9th grade.\n\nI teach 8th graders an advanced biology class that is usually taken by 9th graders. For the last two years my 8th grade, inner-city kids have excelled in this course. At least part of their success can be attributed to last year's camping trip.\n\nWe recently received heartbreaking news, the recent budget cuts have affected our school in ways we never thought possible. All of our after school programs, tutoring, and sports have been canceled. We have no more money for books or supplies. And, of course, no money for the camping trip the students have been looking forward to. \n\nLast year the trip exceeded all of my expectations. It was an experience most students would probably never have had otherwise. They fell in love with the starry night sky; they relished the fresh air, and marveled and connected with the natural world.  My students were able to learn firsthand about concepts I could only otherwise teach them through a textbook. They found evidence of ecological succession in the forest, analyzed complex food webs, and learned about waste and conservation by calculating and monitoring their own consumption and waste. All of the lessons were standards aligned and covered exactly what my students needed for their state exam in June. The activities and character building exercises challenged my students to be leaders, compassionate, and helped them grow as people by nudging them out of their comfort zones. \n\nI have not yet told my students that we will not be going camping.  How can I? These are students who are beating the odds, turning the devastating statistics of the education gap upside down by proving that inner-city kids can excel at rigorous academic classes and more importantly that they can ALL go to college. I may not be able to bring sports or tutoring back to my school, but with your help, we can bring meaningful, quality, life-changing educational experiences to deserving children. "

I'm a middle school (6th-8th grades) mathematics teacher at I.S. 318 in the Bronx.\n\nRecently, our classroom received a mathematics library set. The set consists of 15-20 fiction and nonfiction books related to mathematics. They teach students about money, geometry, fractions, algebra, etc. \n\nWhile some of my students enjoy reading them, the majority, who have recently arrived to this country and whose English language skills are not strong, shy away from the books. Since these students are focused on decoding the text, they cannot focus on the mathematical concept. So, reading becomes tedious and time-consuming.\n\nBut, I believe that, with practice, they can master these books! If we are given a listening center (radio with CD/cassette, headsets, and microphone), I can invite the advanced English students to record a reading of the text. Afterwards, the beginning English students can practice listening to the recording as they read at home and in class. With time, these students will feel comfortable with the text, and they can record themselves reading the book. This activity will teach literacy and math simultaneously. With time, our classroom will develop a library of recorded readings that students can enjoy over and over again.\n\nI.S. 318 is located in a high-poverty area of the Bronx. We service many students from shelters and foster homes. Yet, the caring staff really transforms our school environment into a nurturing and safe haven.

My classroom does not have them, and in first-grade it is a vital resource to have. Coloring helps material come alive for them, particularly the books they will be authoring themselves throughout the year. Without the ability to illustrate them and let the pictures in their head come alive on the page, it simply won't be as effective in making them excited to write. \n\nFor each of my twenty-five students to have their own box of crayons to keep in their desk will go a long way toward improving their conception of school in general and make projects come alive.

","Have you ever seen a famous painting and wondered what it means or who painted it or how it was created? Students in my class will study famous artists and their paintings and recreate those paintings in their own ways using their own style and creativity. \n\nI teach 90 4th graders who are 85% Hispanic and 95% low income at a public charter school. Most of these students are learning English as their second language, so art will help them communicate with their classmates and school through creativity and expression. \n\nArt is the perfect medium for second language learners to express themselves. They are given the opportunity to learn about famous artists from all over the world, opening up their minds to other cultures, styles, and histories. We study various artists such as Frida Kahlo, Henri Matisse, Rene Magritte, Georgia O'Keeffe, Jasper Johns, and Georges Seurat. We read about the artist to gain knowledge about the time period and country that inspired their art and we study and analyze many of their famous paintings. Then students create a masterpiece of their own in a similar style while maintaining their individuality and creativity. At the end of the year, we have an art show where students can showcase their art and share their knowledge with the community. The items I am requesting are art paper, different types of paints, paint brushes, black art pens, art pencils, construction paper, glue, and books about the famous artists. \n\nToday's education primarily focuses on standardized testing, so students, especially those who struggle and who have many intervention classes throughout the day, need to have a way to express themselves and show their creativity since the rest of the day is filled with intense learning in order to help them catch up. While this education is necessary, students also need the arts to give them a well-rounded education and help them enjoy their schooling experience. "

For many of them the academic challenges that face them at school roll into social and personal difficulties waiting when they get home.  Math should not be one of those challenges. \n\nMy 4th grade students attend a public school in Washington, DC.  Our students' reading levels and math abilities are still lagging far behind the national average although our school is working hard to change this.  Due to the importance of literacy, our school places more priority on reading instruction.  While understandable, this results in less focus and money spent on math instruction. \n\nMy Donor's Choose Project 1/3 Focus + 2/3 Effort=Discover Math!, will provide my class with all the materials to successfully implement math centers in my classroom.  Centers engage students in exploratory learning and allow a teacher to target specific gaps in knowledge with individual students.  Centers also keep students active and help them view numbers as a real-life, tangible thing instead of the vague concept it was for me when I was in school.  While centers have many benefits, they can fall apart if they are not well-managed, which is where the pocket chart organizers become a critical component.  Timers and Dry Erase activity sheets are another key piece because they allow stations to be entirely managed by students without constant teacher upkeep.  I chose activities that focus on the main challenges facing our 4th graders: fractions, multiplication and division. \n\nIf our students can master multiplication, division, and fraction fluency by the end of the school year, they will be on track for success in the critical middle school years. And we all know that we love what we're good at! I'm confident that the 1/3 Focus + 2/3 Effort= Discover Math! project will help all my students discover the joy in math and number fluency. "

Once they collect data, they will analyze it using the LabQuest software on the NEW CLASSROOM COMPUTER. \n\nA classroom computer will provide the ""Wow!"" factor that inspires students to learn. As they work on lab reports, students gain experience in how to effectively work together as a group. At the same time, they are learning to use the latest Internet technology that is common in industry. Ultimately, students are preparing for a career in one of the STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) fields, which are vital to the growth of our community, our economy, and our nation.

The world of science can be entered through exciting new technology. My students need lessons that are interactive and engaging, yet effective. \n\nOur students come from rough neighborhoods and deal with poverty everyday. It is hard to receive funding for school projects and materials from both home and the school district. However they are brave and fearless, striving to prosper in school each day. With the right materials these students can really thrive and receive a good education. These students crave the opportunity to explore as they learn and what better to do so than through the use of interactive websites. Students love to learn through all types of media. \n\nThe digital projector will provide visual aide for engaging lesson that will increase student comprehension.\n\nThe projector will also allow my students to learn the standards and the state content in a way that is engaging and supportive.

And, most of our students do not have the funds to purchase these items themselves.  So, often they must do without or the teachers must provide them. \n\nMost of my students are in the 9th grade, just entering high school.  They are very unsure of themselves and unbelievably afraid of making a mistake.  Many times they would rather do nothing than fail.  So, they need as much of an edge as possible in order to succeed.  They need to have access to the latest technology.  Unfortunately, my students do not even have scientific calculators.

My students face many challenges at home, and outside of school \n\nMy classroom is very diverse, and I have several students who primarily speak a language other than English at home. My students often come from large working families who are often able to provide little for their children educationally. I would like their learning experience to be positive so that all of my students become lifelong learners.  \n\nI am requesting a Tag Reader, and various books to use with the Tag Reader. Tag Readers are great for students who are learning how to read fluently. Tag Readers help students become proficient readers by allowing them to hear the words aloud, and follow along. The stories for Tag Readers are appealing, and of high-interest to my students. The books and Tag Readers will help my students learn new words, and read fluently. This will act as a fun tool for students who are working below grade level.  \n\nThanks to the generous support of Donorschoose donors, we have already had one project for Donorschoose funded for Tag Readers, but I would like to expand our library, and offer students a greater selection.  \n\nMy students who struggle with reading often become frustrated, and the Tag Readers and books will help them become more confident readers.

The climate at our school is one where academic achievement is valued, by both students and their families. \n\nThere is very limited funding for new technology for our school. Much of our technology is antiquated.  Students need interactive instruction in writing, literature, grammar, and writing conventions.  They also need to be able to present their knowledge and finished work to the class.  Although I try my best to provide as many opportunities for students to do this, I am not as effective as I would like to be.  \n\nAn Elmo Camera Presenter would enable students to have this opportunity on a daily basis.  With this tool, students will be able to both learn new material in an interactive way, and they will be able to present their learning to the the class.

I am writing to you in reference to a wonderful group of children that attend school in the Bronx.  They are a very unique student population that spans the spectrum of various special needs. Despite their range of disabilities, nothing... repeat, nothing... gets them down. They are so excited to come to school every day, as I am one of the lucky ones to receive and greet them at the school bus, Monday-Friday. I do not think one could meet a happier, more affectionate, and more energetic group of children departing the school bus and ready to come to school, anywhere. They can't wait to come to school! With that said, I was told about Donors Choose, and urged to look into it. I have heard wonderful things about this organization and its members, so I thought I would give this a try. \n\nMy name is Patricia Matone, and I am extremely fortunate to be a specialty teacher at this particular school. Due to my specialty, I have the great fortune to see most of the student population and have gained a great appreciation for their hard work and positive attitude towards life in general. I must admit that I have learned much more from this student population than I could ever teach them.  To say they are wonderful and inspirational children would surely be an understatement. \n\nEvery month we have an award assembly called PBIS, which stands for Positive Behavior Instructional Service.  Usually this is held in the auditorium of the shared schools and it lasts about half an hour to forty five minutes.  The children are given certificate awards for various achievements, and then it is over.  \n\nThis brings me to my request for you. I believe these children most definitely deserve much more than a paper certificate to award them for their achievements.  My goal is for something tangible that they could appreciate and understand that they are special and are being celebrated for all that they do. Therefore, I have decided to organize the PBIS celebration for Thursday, May 1, 2014.  My vision is for each student to have a fabulous musical and visual experience, while dressed in their various party hats and leis. As each class is called up to the stage, I would like them to receive an inexpensive medal on a red, white, and blue ribbon, a rosette ribbon, and/or a small plastic trophy. In addition to the awards, I would love for them to enjoy as an extra surprise, a small trinket toy, pencil and eraser, and objects of that genre.  This is my vision and goal for the upcoming PBIS celebration assembly.\n \n\nIf you have the power to make someone happy, do it. The World needs more of that.  \n\nIf anyone can contribute towards this planned Super Celebration, I would really appreciate it immensely, not to mention the happiness you would bring to these beautiful children with special needs.  Any donation would be a great help.  One way or another, this will be a TRUE Celebration of the children on May 1st, 2014.  Thanks for your time and consideration. "

By ""adopting"" a student and providing that student with a Chromebook, you'll be giving them access to the entire world. \n\nWe are a culturally diverse community, which is reflected in our school. The students in my classroom are young and energetic, just like most middle school students. What sets my students apart is their compassion for each other. Students at Evergreen look out for one another as they progress through middle school. Little things make the difference, like helping students who dropped their supplies in the hall, or volunteering with our medical needs students. Our students are inclusive, creative, and spontaneous. Each day is new, and our students can't wait to meet it. \n\nWith a class set of Chromebooks, students can instantly access the Internet, which is crucial for current research. There is very little load time, which allows for more work and instruction time. (This is an issue with the old computers we currently have in the lab.) Because they access the web through wifi, Chromebooks are also portable, which allows them to be used anywhere in the building. Google is willing to set-up Chrome accounts for each student for free, which will allow them access to word processing software, presentation software, and more. Students can create projects, and simply share them with me via the net, eliminating the need for paper, and hopefully helping us reduce our paper budget, and waste. Students can also get instant feedback on assignments, because we can both be editing the same document in real time. We will also have access to virtually infinite texts online for teachers to use in every discipline we teach. \n\nChromebooks will open up unlimited possibilities for students and teachers. They have instant access to infinite information online, and can create, edit, and share their projects instantly with teachers and peers. Students will be learning how to use technology in addition to the standard classroom curriculum, better preparing them for future employment. "

The suitcase will allow Flat Stanley to travel home with students on the weekends. Students will be able to work with their parents to create and record their own Flat Stanley adventures at home.

Students will create Shark Week videos, describe fashion in French and solve the problem of finding water in Ecuador. \n\nIf we can provide students with two complete computer labs then we can put technology in the hands of every student in our building. Presently, one lab does not support the needs of 275 students in our building. Our goal is to provide students with 21st century learning skills. "

Is it the Pythagorean theorem or is it an experience that you shared with your peers? In most cases it is an experience. What if that experience could also be the culminating learning activity for a class? That is the physics boat race.  \n\nMy students are high school kids ranging in age from 15 to 18.  They attend a public high school with a traditional option and the International Baccalaureate Program.  32% of our school's population qualifies for free and reduced lunch.  My students have worked hard to acquire the math skills to take physics.  The majority of them are already in pre-calculus and calculus. Additionally, almost all of my students are bound for a university education.  This project keeps them interested in pursuing engineering at the collegiate level in addition to fostering team work and creativity. \n\nThe Physics Cardboard Regatta is a culminating engineering activity for the college preparatory Physics classes each year. Basically a contest of ingenuity and resourcefulness, students form teams of three or four and construct a two-person boat made from nothing more than corrugated cardboard and white glue. Given the material, the boats will sink. The object then becomes to build a boat that will travel the farthest before it sinks - hence the fun of the Cardboard Regatta! Physics students utilize principles of streamline design and buoyancy, as well as attention to basic detail in waterproofing, to compete. The boat must travel 100 feet to qualify - then the race begins to complete as many laps in 15 minutes or before it sinks, whichever comes first. May the best boat win!\n \nThis activity is currently in its nineteenth year and past students still mention the impact the event had on their decision to go into a field of engineering/design. \n\nThe physics cardboard regatta has grown into a community event. Students attend a neighborhood clean-up the week before the race. Each spring there is more support for the event and students not only learn about engineering, but about contributing to community.

Some students need the option of being able to listen to books and take these ipods home so they can hear the stories as many times as they need to comprehend. \n\nMy students are active 6th graders who thrive for success.  My students attend a 4-8 grade school with a very high poverty level.  Our small, rural Tennessee school lacks in technology for the students.  I want to give them every opportunity to have the resources other school systems give their students. \n\nI am a regular education teacher of reading who has been blessed with the addition of several special education students due to budget cuts.  I have done extensive research on audio books for the classroom.  I believe these struggling readers would benefit from being able to take an ipod home with the current novel we are reading in class downloaded so they can listen to the story as many times as needed for comprehension.  Also, these students, as well as others, can listen to different books in centers during our DEAR (drop everything and read) times. \n\nI became a reading teacher because of a bad experience I had with one of my reading teachers.  She had a terrible impact on my desire to read. I turned away from my passion of reading because I was told I wasn't a good reader.  I want to light a fire under all my reading students and be a positive influence in their reading lives and success. "

The school does not have many dictionaries, and there is only one student dictionary in my class.

I have 2 dictionaries on my shelf and often times my social studies students come across words they do not need in readings and narratives.  \n\nMy students are a diverse group from various socioeconomic backgrounds in Durham, NC. They all have different reading levels, and writing levels. We have many students with no access to online materials at home, no outside reading materials, and no extra funds to buy the resources needed to improve learning at home.  \n\nStudents rely on textbooks, secondary materials, curriculum and other educational texts to learn. More and more, I am finding that students are reading at lower and lower lexile levels. This is an obstacle to their learning. These dictionaries will allow them to look up words, complete vocabulary squares and take ownership of their learning.  \n\nI grew up with a dictionary always at hand, but many of my students do not have that advantage. Having these always at their disposal in class will allow them to broaden their vocabulary, increase their Lexile scores and help them with understanding the non-social studies vocabulary that pops up in their readings.

The four walls of our classroom function not only as a place of learning, but also as a fully-functional newsroom.  My students report, write, and edit every story in the newspaper's bimonthly newspaper.  I am proud to tell anyone who will listen that they create every square inch of every page of every issue.  My students are passionate about the stories they write which range from the boilerplate high school teenage drama to the latest national debate and how it connects to our everyday lives.  While my students are incredibly proud of the work they do, I think they are only beginning to understand the historical importance of the words they write.  By the end of the year, I am confident that they will walk away from their experiences empowered to share the stories of their community with the rest of the world. \n\nWhile our newsroom is place of energy, ambition, and progress, there is one tool they keep requesting.  In their interviews with parents, students, teachers, and staff, they are often surprised and how openly and honestly people will discuss issues with them.  They often can't keep up with their interviews.  They have not yet developed the note-taking skills needed to accurately report the words their subjects speak.  They have asked me over and over for voice recorders so that they can delve more deeply into the topics they cover and more accurately reflect their content of their interviews.  This is by far the number one request students have made.  They are not interested in adding extra pictures and graphics -- they want to share other peoples' ideas with the readers of their newspaper. \n\nAny contributions to this project will empower my students to take their newspaper farther, faster.  These voice recorders will improve the quality of my students' reporting and ensure that the important stories in our community are heard crystal clear. "
